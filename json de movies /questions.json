(<Question 'What is the first occurence of a sequence of short shots of the same length separated by fade ins/outs?' @ 7fb7618e5350>,)
{u'has_more': True, u'items': [{u'body': u'<p>In the Real World, Fischer wasn\'t kidnapped, but sedated on an airplane.  As far as he knows, he drifted off to sleep naturally, with nothing to fear.  The kidnapping occurred in a dream, and like any dream you or I might have, there\'s a tendency to just "go with it" while you\'re dreaming.  In reality, you would NEVER trust a skeezy fat guy in a white panel van offering you candy if you get inside.  In a dream, however, you might just go along with it (and there might even be candy!)</p>\n\n<p>After that, each new layer of dreaming is like a dream to the dream-person in the previous layer.  A dream within a dream, quite literally.  The only people in full cognitive control are the ones hooked up to the machines; aka Cobb and his gang, in this case.</p>\n\n<p>As for the projections; Fischer had "training" to "resist dream infiltration" but he likely had no idea what that resistance would look like in an actual dream.  It\'s not like somebody told Fischer in reality "look out for the guards dressed liked this and obey them no matter what because they\'re your protector projections."  For one thing, a dream can take ANY form, and the projections that resist infiltration would naturally take whatever form is most appropriate for the dream, so they aren\'t static.  For another thing, if the projections were static or had a static symbol, an infiltrator could theoretically learn what that symbol is and mimic it after he gets inside your dream.  That would be a weakness in the training program.  The projections operate at a subconscious level to stop the infiltrators no matter what the actual dreamer wants or does, this is the only way to make sure they can\'t be corrupted themselves.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, since Cobb and his team kept Fischer close on each level of the dream, they were able to manipulate "what happened" in the dream and tell Fischer what they wanted him to do or think about.  Fischer "went with it" because he was dreaming without a dream machine, and as long as Cobb could keep Fischer away from the projections, they couldn\'t stop him.  This is ultimately what inception is all about, after all.  Making someone think an idea was theirs when it really wasn\'t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternatively</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you prefer to take the position that the entire movie was a dream - including the layer that Cobb thought of as "reality" - then Fischer himself becomes just another element of <em>Cobb\'s dream.</em>  Fischer does what\'s necessary to keep the dream going as a figment of Cobb\'s imagination, and Cobb "just goes with it."</p>\n', u'question_id': 62949, u'last_activity_date': 1479391598, u'creation_date': 1479338826, u'score': 1, u'owner': {u'user_id': 43124, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/bM2Xa.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 215, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/43124/steve-o', u'display_name': u'Steve-O'}, u'is_accepted': False, u'last_edit_date': 1479391598, u'answer_id': 63393}, {u'body': u'<p><strong>At most, <em>Doctor Strange</em> is set over a period of 3 and a half years.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Between out-of-universe information and in-universe references, we can safely assume that between the start of the movie and the first end credits scene, no more than 3 and a half years have elapsed.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing we need to do is ignore a reference to an experimental armour that we hear before Stephen Strange crashes his car. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/56w0q6/hey_everyone_reading_through_everything_will/d8mxv6y/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Director Scott Derrickson recently confirmed that this is not meant to be Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes</a>, meaning that we cannot use this as evidence for when the film is set.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/91457/who-is-stephen-strange-in-the-mcu/141763#141763">This answer</a> from @phantom42 includes a link to an <a href="http://comicbook.com/2016/09/27/details-behind-doctor-stranges-captain-america-winter-soldier-ea" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interview with Kevin Feige</a> that confirms that at the time of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, Stephen Strange is just a highly talented neurosurgeon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>"He is very well-known as a surgeon," Feige said during a recent visit to the set of Doctor Strange. "He has got various awards and plaques you\'re going to see over there; he attends various galas, might be driving at one point in this movie. He has name recognition and a talent and certain Hydra computers identified him as somebody that could cause trouble for their agendas."</p>\n  \n  <p>So the answer is, Strange wasn\'t an immediate threat to Hydra in any meaningful way, but as a brilliant and famous person whose agenda didn\'t mesh with theirs, he stood a high probability of being a problem for them if they successfully took over government. Think of it like a politician targeting Bruce Springsteen or Ted Nugent because they might use their concerts as a platform to spread a message the politician in question didn\'t like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This conclusively proves that as of spring 2014, Stephen Strange has not yet had his car crash. This means that we know for sure that he does not start his training until some point after spring 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Our "end point" comes in the form of a post-credits scene in which;</p>\n\n<blockquote class="spoiler">\n  <p> Doctor Strange offers to help Thor and Loki find Odin on Earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a teaser for;</p>\n\n<blockquote class="spoiler">\n  <p> <em>Thor Ragnarok</em>, which is set to come out in autumn 2017.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming that the film above is set in roughly the same time period that it is released (as tends to be the case with most films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), then we know for sure that <em>Doctor Strange</em> ends by autumn 2017.</p>\n\n<p>As such, at the very most, <em>Doctor Strange</em> takes place between spring 2014 and autumn 2017, a period of 3 and a half years. It\'s worth noting that there are some people reporting that they saw trophies/awards in his apartment at the start of the movie dated 2016 (which would obviously severely reduce the period the film is set over to around about 18 months), but as I cannot verify those claims I have not taken them into account in this answer.</p>\n\n<p>As for the word of God answer, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottderrickson/status/799246156949655553" rel="nofollow noreferrer">when asked about this on Twitter, director Scott Derrickson simply replied</a>;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>"Time is relative"</p>\n</blockquote>\n', u'question_id': 62872, u'last_activity_date': 1479391384, u'comments': [{u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 99831, u'creation_date': 1478510765, u'post_id': 62884, u'score': 2, u'owner': {u'user_id': 19762, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4yIy.png?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 1252, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/19762/luciano', u'display_name': u'Luciano'}}, {u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 99854, u'creation_date': 1478524561, u'post_id': 62884, u'score': 0, u'owner': {u'user_id': 1146, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6799197a1a304615c60467081a4124a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 20271, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/1146/kutulumike', u'accept_rate': 100, u'display_name': u'KutuluMike'}}, {u'edited': False, u'reply_to_user': {u'user_id': 1146, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6799197a1a304615c60467081a4124a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 20271, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/1146/kutulumike', u'accept_rate': 100, u'display_name': u'KutuluMike'}, u'comment_id': 99860, u'creation_date': 1478525361, u'post_id': 62884, u'score': 0, u'owner': {u'user_id': 8686, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/s8qZP.png?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 8390, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/8686/dr-r-dizzle', u'accept_rate': 86, u'display_name': u'Dr R Dizzle'}}, {u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 99955, u'creation_date': 1478574958, u'post_id': 62884, u'score': 1, u'owner': {u'user_id': 1046, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/OQ9iv.png?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 2674, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/1046/phantom42', u'display_name': u'phantom42'}}], u'creation_date': 1478509058, u'score': 13, u'owner': {u'user_id': 8686, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/s8qZP.png?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 8390, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/8686/dr-r-dizzle', u'accept_rate': 86, u'display_name': u'Dr R Dizzle'}, u'is_accepted': True, u'last_edit_date': 1479391384, u'answer_id': 62884}, {u'body': u'<p>He says in that scene </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HR: "What you\'ve just been witness to is my partner\'s likeness, Randolph Morgan."</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the previous episode, "Monster," HR comes clean about his lack of scientific credentials, telling the group:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HR: "There are two parts to every idea: the inception, and the execution.

Looks like in the previous loop,\n  due to slightly modified events, Hannah now ends up being the\n  farthest. In the last sequence, the first to recollect his memories\n  was Renton.

The loop resets and a new sequence begins. That\'s all. They get shot in the 9th loop of the previous series but the ARQ caues a loop reset and everything begins again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would this be enough to get the ARQ successfully to the Bloc?

But now\n  given Hannah is the first to wake up, it may lead to them not checking\n  the logs soon enough.

This in a way does not make sense, unless there is one creature known as a \'Griever\' that patrols the maze at day, then why didn\'t the camp get attacked at day? Alby was stung in the maze the day after Ben was banished from the camp for attacking Thomas. When stung, the Gladers discovered you remember everything and Ben did so with great ferocity. The Techno-Flesh creatures (Grievers) apparently had a sting,but nothing mentions how many stings they have, anyhow they can just keep stinging and not lose the venom in the sting? But at night, this makes more sense because the doors close to the maze protecting the children on the inside and Grievers roam the maze killing any Gladers that may have gotten stuck in the maze at night. But they did mention that \'no-on has ever gotten trapped in the maze and gotten out alive\' mentions Newt and this tells me that there is always a Griever in the maze at any given moment, how else can Gladers get stung during the day? unless there was something else in the maze no one actually knows about?\nIn the control room there are cameras watching the Gladers as Newt discovers when they are escaped from the maze, the Controllers might have actually been stinging them somehow because Grievers come out at night, not day, so it must be the Controllers stinging them with hidden stingers or whatever it is inside the maze It could lso be the Ivy but Thomas hides in the Ivy so I can\'t be that, there might be hidden stingers in the Ivy or there could be dart blowers on top the walls, who knows, but this is my guess, but then why weren\'t the others stung at day including Minho? unless there are dead grievers where they accidentally got crushed in the walls, they might have found these and found it was the sting and stung themselves or accidenally got stung.

I do agree that the show shot the scene for dramatic effect. However...</p>\n\n<p>In the chapter that Bran awkens he is not warged into Summer. He was with the three-eyed raven, who was telling Bran he must fly. He only see the part of the interaction down on the Kingsroad </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. - <em>A Game of Thrones, Chapter 16</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, right after that he then has a vision of the Free Cities, Vaes Dothrak, and Asshai. </p>\n\n<p>Finally Bran finds himself seeing North of the Wall into the Lands of Always Winter. Bran is falling and the three-eyed raven is trying to get Bran to fly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>North and north and north he looked comedy the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of Winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.</p>\n  \n  <p>\'Now you know\', the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. Now you know why you must live.</p>\n  \n  <p>\'Why?\' Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling. <em>Because winter is coming</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bran figures out how to fly and it seems the three-eyed raven opens Bran\'s third eye as well. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It took to the air, flapping its wings in his face, slowing him, blinding him. He faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks. It\'s being stabbed at him fiercely, and Bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead, between his eyes.</p>\n  \n  <p>\'What are you doing?\' He shrieked.</p>\n  \n  <p>the crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mist shuttered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he remembered her now, and then he realized that he was in Winterfell, in a bed and some chilly tower room, and the black haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps shouting,  \'he\'s awake, he\'s awake, he\'s awake\'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that it is the three-eyed raven that woke  Bran. I do not feel that it could have been the killing of Lady because Bran has not even show a connection to Summer at this point. </p>\n\n<p>Again, the show was going for dramatic effect, but I feel that since the show was being very faithful the source in Season 1, that an answer from the book is appropriate. </p>\n', u'question_id': 56770, u'last_activity_date': 1479316389, u'creation_date': 1469836973, u'score': 2, u'owner': {u'user_id': 28011, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxq9Y.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 2668, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/28011/skooba', u'display_name': u'Skooba'}, u'is_accepted': False, u'last_edit_date': 1479316389, u'answer_id': 57472}, {u'body': u'<p>I\'m almost certain the movie you\'re talking about is called "Morgan" ! </p>\n', u'question_id': 60595, u'last_activity_date': 1479316054, u'comments': [{u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 100730, u'creation_date': 1479316087, u'post_id': 63370, u'score': 0, u'owner': {u'user_id': 43290, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/016ee71db9f5c826e961ec2a09c01017?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG', u'user_type': u'unregistered', u'reputation': 10, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/43290/sol-morningstar', u'display_name': u'Sol Morningstar'}}, {u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 100732, u'creation_date': 1479316782, u'post_id': 63370, u'score': 0, u'owner': {u'user_id': 41249, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4f59d7c4ebc4c933571a9fe9f584dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 1645, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/41249/john', u'display_name': u'John'}}], u'creation_date': 1479316054, u'score': -3, u'owner': {u'user_id': 43290, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/016ee71db9f5c826e961ec2a09c01017?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG', u'user_type': u'unregistered', u'reputation': 10, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/43290/sol-morningstar', u'display_name': u'Sol Morningstar'}, u'is_accepted': True, u'answer_id': 63370}, {u'body': u'<p>If we want a <em>non-metaphorical</em> (aka literal) interpretation of the Babadook, then we start with the assumption that the monster is real.  If the monster is real, it stands to reason that the poem in the book is also real, and accurately telling us the rules by which the monster lives.  (They tried to destroy the book several times and it kept coming back, so the book is clearly supernatural itself, and tied to the monster.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the last scene of The Babadook when Amelia takes worms downstairs to the \n  babadook: Why is it there? Is it by choice or is it a captive?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>"If it\'s in a word or it\'s in a book / you can\'t get rid of the Babadook."</em></p>\n\n<p>The monster is effectively immortal.  You can\'t get rid of it entirely, once you\'ve let it in.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How did telling it not to harm her son drive it off?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>"I\'ll make a wager, yes / I\'ll make a bet / The more you deny me / the stronger I\'ll get"</em></p>\n\n<p>The Babadook becomes stronger when people deny its existence.</p>\n\n<p>At first, the mother tells Sam the monster isn\'t real and denies the strange things she sees.  This gives the monster power over her and allows it to possess her, doing progressively scarier things.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the movie, she screams at the Babadook and tells it to leave her son alone.  By addressing the monster directly like this, she is implicitly showing that she believes it\'s real, and so it loses its hold over her and retreats.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why worms?!?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To stay safe from the monster, they have to acknowledge that it exists.  Feeding it, like a pet, is a way of continuing to acknowledge its existence so that it doesn\'t come back.  (Besides, it killed their dog.)  If they ignored it, they might begin to believe it was all some sort of dream or hallucination, which would allow it to return.</p>\n\n<p>As far as "why worms" specifically... why not worms?  What do you feed a scary black shadow monster anyway?  It was probably Sam\'s idea.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>  I do like a lot of the metaphorical answers already given.  The movie has a lot of potential in the metaphorical arena.

The trailer for Season 2 seems to indicate that the story is taking place over a relatively short period of time and reveals that other heroes are present (which is confirmed by <a href="http://www.cbr.com/cassidys-black-canary-atom-more-will-appear-in-vixen-season-2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a>). Using those characters as a guideline, we can better pinpoint when Season 2 takes place.</p>\n\n<h2>Jefferson Jackson is Firestorm</h2>\n\n<p>So it has to take place after <em>The Flash</em> episode 2x04 "<a href="http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/The_Fury_of_Firestorm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Fury of Firestorm</a>", which is when he became it.</p>\n\n<h2>Ray Palmer (the Atom) isn\'t presumed dead</h2>\n\n<p>The Season 2 trailer shows us that Ray Palmer will join the cast. Ray was presumed dead at the end of <em>Arrow</em> Season 3 and rescued in 4x06 "<a href="http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Lost_Souls" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lost Souls</a>". Since Jax is present as Firestorm, it has to be after that rather than during Season 3.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely though, Ray seems to have no problem being out in the open, despite everyone thinking that he was dead. However, we do see that he was using the suit in the pilot of <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Mark Mardon (The Weather Wizard) is not in Iron Heights</h2>\n\n<p>Mardon appeared in <em>The Flash</em> 4x09 "<a href="http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Running_to_Stand_Still" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Running to Stand Still</a>" where he was arrested by the end and sent to Iron Heights. So it must take place before that.</p>\n\n<h2>Jax and Ray are not time traveling</h2>\n\n<p>The pilot episode for <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> takes place at the beginning of the year 2016 (sometime after <em>Arrow</em> 4x09 and <em>The Flash</em> 2x09, both of which took place before Christmas the previous year), and began with them being whisked away on a time-traveling adventure. So it would either have to take place before that or at some point after they return. But we know it\'s not after because...</p>\n\n<h2>Laurel Lance is Black Canary</h2>\n\n<p>Laurel stopped being Black Canary in <em>Arrow</em> 4x18 "<a href="http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Eleven-Fifty-Nine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eleven-Fifty Nine</a>" because</p>\n\n<blockquote class="spoiler">\n  <p> Damien Darhk killed her</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> made it a plot point in 1x16 "<a href="http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Legendary</a>" that this couldn\'t be changed through time travel. So we know that <em>Vixen</em> Season 2 doesn\'t take place after this.</p>\n\n<h2>Given all this, <em>Vixen</em> Season 2 must take place sometime after <em>Arrow</em> 4x06 and before <em>The Flash</em> 2x10</h2>\n\n<p>Since the in-universe dates roughly correspond with the original air dates, this suggests that <em>Vixen</em> Season 2 takes place in November or December of 2015.</p>\n\n<h2>But what about <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> 2x02 where the team meets a previous Vixen and act like they\'ve never seen her powers before?</h2>\n\n<p>In this episode, the Legends are in 1942 and meet the Justice Society of America, among them Amaya Jiwe. Neither Jefferson Jackson, Martin Stein, nor Ray Palmer comment on the fact that they have seen her necklace before and seem surprised by her animal powers. In fact, Ray Palmer calls her "Animal Girl" before she corrects him and says that in the field she goes by "Vixen". Ray doesn\'t react to the fact that her descendant, whom he met, used the same name (given by Cisco). </p>\n\n<p>I doubt that the three of them chose not to mention her descendant in order to preserve the timeline (given how often the Legends disregard it). So the only reason I can think of for this is that it\'s a production goof. The <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> episode was filmed in August 2016, before Vixen Season 2 aired. I don\'t know when the voices were recorded, but it seems that someone didn\'t get the memo about this crossover.</p>\n', u'question_id': 62228, u'last_activity_date': 1479310503, u'comments': [{u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 98736, u'creation_date': 1477216310, u'post_id': 62249, u'score': 1, u'owner': {u'user_id': 33741, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33d04b3df6cfc22f6e75e33c5b0dc05a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 386, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/33741/mafia36790', u'accept_rate': 50, u'display_name': u'MAFIA36790'}}], u'creation_date': 1477190278, u'score': 4, u'owner': {u'user_id': 12783, u'profile_image': u'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b1afaea7df2571e04379ebf860e239e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 3309, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/12783/thunderforge', u'accept_rate': 84, u'display_name': u'Thunderforge'}, u'is_accepted': True, u'last_edit_date': 1479310503, u'answer_id': 62249}, {u'body': u"<p>Many deleted scenes are cut rather quickly from the movie's timeline.

Film dailies get expensive, so many are recorded onto DVD which reduces the image quality.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are also plenty of movies in existence where a scene was removed later in the process.  In these cases, the complete scene was filmed, processed, edited and re-sync'd, but for whatever reason was decided to be left out of the film.

According to Illyrio, the eggs are from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, and they have turned to stone over eons of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is the scene when the eggs are gifted (thanks to <a href="http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/1146/kutulumike">KutuluMike</a>):</p>\n\n<p><div class="youtube-embed"><div>\r\n                <iframe width="640px" height="395px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0IhEYId-rQ?start=191"></iframe>\r\n            </div></div></p>\n\n<p>There is more information from the books that is not obvious in the series, but that is relevant (again, from the <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragon_egg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To Daenerys, the eggs are huge, and are the most beautiful things she has ever seen. They are patterned in such rich colors that at first she thinks they are crusted in jewels, and so large that it takes both of her hands to hold one. When Dany lifts one, she expects it to be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel or even blown glass, but it is much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell is covered with tiny scales, and as she turns the egg between her fingers, it shimmers like polished metal in the light of the setting sun.</p>\n  \n  <p>The eggs are beautiful colors. One egg is a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that comes and goes depending on how Dany turns it. Another egg is pale cream streaked with gold. The last egg is black as the midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls.</p>\n  \n  <p>Dany feels heat from her dragon eggs, where others feel only cold.

Hilarity ensues.</p>\n\n<p>The OVA from 1991 opens with Ryu\'s father stealing the android shell from his ex-wife\'s tech company, having it in the back of his car, and driving like a maniac to escape attack helicopters sent to catch him in what could certainly be called a car chase, of sorts.  He does drive over a bridge at one point during the scene, although he doesn\'t technically escape then.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t remember any prison camp or flowers, but the show did have its share of wacky antics and heartfelt moments.  Nuku Nuku certainly cares for Ryu, although it\'s not romantic love, more like sisterly love.  She\'s also perfectly well aware of her own origin and the fact that she\'s a robot.</p>\n\n<p>The ending wasn\'t sad at all, but Nuku Nuku was certainly capable of emotion and may have cried at points.  I\'ve only seen the original OVA, but there was at least one TV series reboot in 1998, and possibly a second since.  Perhaps one of those has the missing scenes and a similar opening?</p>\n\n<h1>2) El Hazard: The Magnificent World</h1>\n\n<p>Another OVA series from the 90\'s.  It doesn\'t start with a car chase or a package being delivered, although it certainly does have an android girl who arrives near the beginning.  The fact that she\'s a robot was not a secret to her, but it wasn\'t revealed to us as viewers until part-way through.  She later falls in love and there\'s a tear-jerker of an ending, for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Between the two, I\'m thinking Nuku Nuku has a better chance of being right.</p>\n', u'question_id': 62286, u'last_activity_date': 1479296716, u'creation_date': 1479264587, u'score': 1, u'owner': {u'user_id': 43124, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/bM2Xa.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 215, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/43124/steve-o', u'display_name': u'Steve-O'}, u'is_accepted': False, u'last_edit_date': 1479296716, u'answer_id': 63341}, {u'body': u'<p>That sounds like Zombie Holocaust.. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the plot line as told by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Holocaust" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In New York City a hospital worker is found to have been devouring\n  bodies in the morgue.

They never had a chance to show any real hostility. Every scene that had cats and dogs were shot keeping them segregated from one another. </p>\n\n<p>To portray Mr. Tinkles, two white Persians (Foster and Fritz) were used, along with a life-sized puppet. There were six puppeteers, who stood under floorboards, inside an underground chamber and in stairs to operate the puppet. This puppet had a computer controlled motors to make Mr Tinkles actions look live.</p>\n\n<p>There were 33 cats and 27 dogs employed in the movie, along with more than a dozen different animatronic puppets and a legion of computer graphics to portray  battle and chase scenes without endangering any animal.</p>\n\n<p>Before shooting started, they scanned animals\' image. They also put sensors to record body dimensions, facial expressions and movement to allow designers to create an unlimited number of actions and expressions. This also helped creating life-sized puppets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How different scenes were filmed:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sidekick of Tinkles was filmed with two exotic shorthairs named Edison and Edgar. They were filmed separately.</li>\n<li>Butch was played by three Anatolian shepherds whereas Lou was played by five pocket beagles.</li>\n<li>Training of cats and dogs began about a year before filming and they were verbally cued to perform some of the more innocuous behaviours. For instance, open warfare breaks out when an orange tabby cat tries to steal a newspaper. The cat was trained to roll with the paper on cue.</li>\n<li>The scene where Buddy chases a cat was filmed separately.</li>\n<li>They used treats to make cats and dogs runs to a certain point. Besides, they also used toys to make them make certain movements.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/news-videos-fun/movie-reviews/the-making-of-cats--dogs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pet Place</a></p>\n', u'question_id': 56990, u'last_activity_date': 1479279995, u'comments': [{u'edited': False, u'comment_id': 100674, u'creation_date': 1479278305, u'post_id': 56994, u'score': 0, u'owner': {u'user_id': 1190, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNm3O.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'moderator', u'reputation': 32771, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/1190/ankit-sharma', u'accept_rate': 92, u'display_name': u'Ankit Sharma'}}, {u'edited': False, u'reply_to_user': {u'user_id': 1190, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNm3O.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'moderator', u'reputation': 32771, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/1190/ankit-sharma', u'accept_rate': 92, u'display_name': u'Ankit Sharma'}, u'comment_id': 100675, u'creation_date': 1479278656, u'post_id': 56994, u'score': 0, u'owner': {u'user_id': 27264, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7Wiu.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 5209, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/27264/abhishek-aggrawal', u'accept_rate': 97, u'display_name': u'Abhishek Aggrawal'}}], u'creation_date': 1468909800, u'score': 5, u'owner': {u'user_id': 27264, u'profile_image': u'https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7Wiu.jpg?s=128&g=1', u'user_type': u'registered', u'reputation': 5209, u'link': u'http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/27264/abhishek-aggrawal', u'accept_rate': 97, u'display_name': u'Abhishek Aggrawal'}, u'is_accepted': True, u'last_edit_date': 1479279995, u'answer_id': 56994}, {u'body': u'<p>It\'s a cut.

Will steps in to stop David and Eden from pressing Claire and she finally manages to get out of the house, immediately followed by Pruitt that suddenly remembers that he blocked Claire's car with his. Will goes to the window and watches Claire getting in her car and driving out of David and Eden's premises, but before she drives away, Claire is called by Pruitt whom we see reaching Claire's driver's window. Will (and the audience with him) is then distracted by David who confronts him about his behaviour. A few minutes later Pruitt gets back and says that he's been out talking with Claire and trying to convince her to come back, but to no avail. This is the last we see/hear of Claire, which completely disappears from the movie.

It was a teenage movie, most probably American.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe protagonist was an average teenager that I remember as looking similar to Vinnie from \u003cem\u003eDoogie Howser\u003c/em\u003e. He somehow (I think accidentally) became a part of a team that represented his school in some kind of a knowledge contest.\nThe contest was basically two or more teams, each consisting of about 4 students, answering questions and getting points for correct answers.\nThere were multiple stages of the contest (county level, state level, etc.), each time there was a host and an audience.\nThe protagonist's team made it to the finale, which I think was even shown in TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously each team consisted of the best students from a given school, so the protagonist, being just an average guy, wasn't a great help for his team.

I think they were only talking. During that evening the protagonist complained that he doesn't understand why the girl likes to study, that he finds it boring, etc. She told him that there are some interesting things even in the English literature and she gave an example of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_petite_mort\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ela petite mort\u003c/a\u003e, i.e. that when old English poets mentioned dying they often meant having an orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the girl was part of the protagonist's team then she wasn't taking part in the finale next day for some reason.

And the main protagonist is also one of the soldier in the US Special Forces Team that is part of this operation. The main protagonist and the rest of the Special Forces Team decide to strike the main base of the Insurgence, where the High ranking offical is also being held as a hostage, at dusk. But, when they finally make it to the Insurgence main base/camp it's all empty and dead silent. And as they move in closer to the base to they are also shocked to see that all the Insurgents and the Hostage have been killed. To be more specific all the bodies are found slaughtered. Actually, the scene had a lot of Gore. As they show body parts like intestine, limbs, eye sockets being empty and all that. And also there was a lot of blood all over the main base. They then look to find if there were any surviors but they don't find any survivors. So, they head back to the Rendezvous Point or RV for extraction. They do reach the extraction point but it would take about 4 or 5 hours for the Helicopters to arrive and pick them up or something like that. So, the soldiers decide to rest up and wait till their pickup arrives as it was late in the night. But, after an hour or so suddenly a soldier starts to scream as he starts to levitate in the air to everyones suprise. Then he starts screaming out even more loud as it seems some unknown entity is pulling out his arms and legs. And they do come out with blood squirting out from his arms and legs to everyone's horror. He then dies. And then quickly a few other soldiers also start to cry out in agony as some unknown entity starts to torment them and kill them. Out of fear and panic everyone starts to fire around. The remaining soldiers then stop firing around as the killings stops. Eventually, only the 2 government agents, the main protagonist, main protagonist friend and 3 other soldiers are the only ones to survive. There is blood everywhere and body parts of their dead commarades all over the ground.

It was about an alien who appeared as a Chinese boy (perhaps around 10 years old) who had the ability to grant wishes. The tone was generally lighthearted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other main character was a single dad who was raising this boy, but didn't know that he was an alien. I think that he got the boy in some incident tied to his deceased wife (it might have been that they wished for a child, and a spaceship came out of the sky right afterwards), but I'm a little fuzzy on this and am not sure if I might be conflating that with another story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first clue the dad got that his child wasn't normal was when they are in a restaurant and the boy asks his father what he wishes for. He doesn't take it seriously and says that he wishes for a lot of money. The boy then grants his wish (with a physical gesture and sound effect, I believe) and a high-class waiter comes to their table with a silver platter upon which there was money of various currencies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI recall that the waiter described the money as one would describe food, something along the lines of \"fresh Yuan, Euro à la mode, Pounds benedict\", etc. Unfortunately, the father mysteriously coming into possession of all this money wound up getting him into trouble with the law who thought he stole it, but this was eventually resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also a subplot with the boy having a female teacher who the boy tried to set up with his father. I can't remember if he had some personal motivation for this, like wanting to have both a mother and a father or if he just wanted his father to be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a later scene, the boy and the father went to a place where new houses were being promoted. The sales person was a large man who made claims like \"it's a fifteen minute drive to Tiananmen Square\". The boy says \"tell the truth!\" (with a camera zoom in on his face and a distorted voice to indicate that he is using his powers) and then the man starts spasming as he's uncontrollably saying the truth to his claims (like it's only 15 minutes away if you drive 200 km/h and there is no traffic, i.e. never).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe salesman was humiliated by the events and somehow finds out that the boy has the ability to grant wishes. I think he had ties to organized crime as well, and has a mook or two who are comedically incompetent. He kidnaps the boy and tries to force him to make a wish (I recall that one of the mooks makes a silly wish too, something like wanting a puppy). I think he held someone hostage, probably the teacher, and threatened to hurt them if the boy didn't grant his wish. He does, but this means he can no longer grant wishes because he did it for someone bad, and the boy knows this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think that scene took place at a toy store and the father came to rescue him, and there were a lot of hijinks that ensued with trying to get the boy to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the boy had broken the rules and granted a wish to a bad man, he had to go back to the aliens.

This is the first time that we see him as a CGI non-human alien and I think he looked somewhat like a \u003ca href=\"http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin_family\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePikmin\u003c/a\u003e. Before he arrived on the ship, his father told him he loved him (and I think there may have been something to do with the spirit of the dead wife in there somewhere). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the boy is allowed to remain on earth, so he goes back down from the tractor beam and morphs back into a Chinese boy.

It's a horror film, but it might have some elements of comedy in it.

But at some point, the girl's cousins show up and kill the guy. She runs away crying. Her hometown is some kind of weird neighborhood of sick junkies. Her mother gets beaten up by her mentally ill lover every single day. One day, the girl watches the lover kill her mother in their bed after the mother refuses to be photographed naked. And there's a hole in my memory after that moment. All I know is that this movie is very twisted and that the town is full of demons. Some people come to the town, and at night, everybody gets killed. I remember one demon playing rock guitar - he looked like a skeleton.

The anime movie is basically set somewhere during \u003cstrong\u003e60's\u003c/strong\u003e. But, it has an \u003cstrong\u003ealternative history plot\u003c/strong\u003e than our real world history. In this movie it is revealed that the Space Race was used as a cover up by both the US and the Soviets military for the deployment of their military forces into space. It is also revealed that sometime during the mid 50's a meteor crashed on earth. And this meteor contained a \"liquid-metal\" or something like that, which enabled both the US and Soviets to secretly build highly advance vehicles with amazing properties. One of the prime example being showcased in the movie is using the \"liqud-metal\" to build Hover Tanks. It is also revealed that all of this is kept a secret from the public(both in the US and Russia).     \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main story starts on the Moon, with the American forces just recently (about 2.5 weeks) landing on the dark side of the moon. The movie follows the view point of an American Soldier named Collins and his platoon. Unfortunately, the American forces are forced off the Moon due to a surprise assault from the Soviets which results in the destruction of their main base. They then relocate to Mars, but find the Soviets are already there. Both sides here then locate alien artifacts, and the Americans also find a factory. The long-dead alien race that created the \"liquid-metal\" is also identified as the Cthonians, who inhabited a planet that is now the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is found out that they visited Earth on several occasions, thus influencing Greek mythology. The Americans also learn of an ultimate weapon called the \"Chimera\" and head to Venus to learn more about it. Another Cthonian relic is recovered there, which also points them to Jupiter's moon Io. The Americans finds a third relic there, but this is stolen by a scientist defecting to the Soviets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Main Protagonist and his platoon are then deployed in Europa and are ordered to steal a Soviet fighter craft and tap into their communications network. The main protagonist and his platoon manage to quickly take care off the small Soviet Outpost in Europa and are able to successfully tap into the Soviets Communication Network. Doing so also reveals to the Americans the Soviets  main base which is located on Saturn's moon, Titan. The Main Protagonist and his Platoon is then Ordered to Hold Back and clean up Europa, while the  Main/Special Assault Forces is sent to Titan to destroy the Soviets Main Base. But the Main Protagonist and his platoon later learn that the Main Assault was a complete Disaster and that almost all of their Main Assault Force was annihilated. So, the Main Protagonist and his platoon are then sent out to Titan to rescue some of their surviving soldiers. It is here they learn that the Soviets were able to recreate the ultimate weapon  'Chimeras' by infusing the materials found from the relics and also the \"liquid-Metal\", into the blood of some of their Soldiers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think sometime later the 'Chimeras' become self aware and realize that the sole purpose of their existence is to destroy all life in the Universe. So, they quickly turn on their creator i.e the Soviets. Although the Soviets suffer a large blow to their forces they are able to escape from complete annihilation. Also, the 'Chimeras' after turning on their Creators they mysteriously blast off from Titan. The Soviets then quickly realizing their mistake in resurrecting the 'Chimeras' decide to ally with the Americans for help in destroying the 'Chimeras'. The Americans and the Soviets then join forces to regroup and launch a final assault. After a few weeks of reconnaissance the Americans and Soviets discover that the 'Chimeras' fled to one of the Moons of Uranus, called Titania. And upon further orbital reconnaissance they find out that the 'Chimeras' are producing more 'Chimera' like beings. So, the Americans and Soviets then decide they must destroy the 'Chimeras' production factory and their Main Base, before the 'Chimeras' assault force can grow larger. But, the problem is the Main Base is located on Sycorax and whereas the Production Factory is located on Titonia. So, they are forced to divide their already smaller force into two smaller forces.  The Main Protagonist and his force are given the Task destroying the Production Factory in Titania while the other force assaults the Main 'Chimera' base in Sycorax. Also, it is shown that the Main Protagonist and all the other soldiers are shown to be really stressed out and worried. Because, they know that they are the only last line of defense. And at that moment they were the only force that was standing in between the 'Chimeras' and the  fate of the 'Universe'. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the movie only till here.

The movie must've come out late 80's to early 90's. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a mob enforcer. He was a bit shorter than average height. Always wore a hat.

He was a doofus, in the way he acted. He always tried to come up with the next big thing. In this instance, he had an idea for the Crazy Straw. Although it wasn't called that in the movie. It did have the design of crazy straws of today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie was most likely set in a town or city with a dock. I'm sure it was Philadelphia, as it reminded me of Rocky. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt one stage in the film, someone needed to be \"taken care of\". I can't recall if it was the main guys or someone else. The hitman was special though. He always got his target.

In addition to the equipment itself, that's a huge cost--the time of the gaffers and the waiting non-gaffers. Of course, relying on natural light can be costly, as you wait on the right sun/cloud combo, but Malick and others get great images off of available (i.e., there anyway) light bulbs too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom The Revenant to Barry Lyndon to Swingers to selected scenes in Amadeus and The Bourne Identity, natural/available light is used seamlessly and beautifully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, why do the other 98% of movies spend millions of dollars a piece on seemingly unnecessary equipment, labor, and time?

It's not \"explain light to me\" or \"does artificial lighting produce a different image\". Those answers are all obvious and unnecessary. The question is more about a cost/benefit analysis. So let me clarify:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow much time/money is spent waiting for gaffers/cinematographers vs how much time/money would be spent waiting for natural light or using available light that would yield a similar --but not identical-- image? Of course this will vary based on the setting, time of day, etc., but if you have some estimates of particular scenarios, that would be great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's clear from the comments/answers that many people value a stylized, deliberate visual aesthetic. I don't. I prefer the look of available light and, perhaps more importantly, incidental camera placement. I would expect these two strategies to be very cheap and fast. And since I am --at best--ambivalent whether a scene is \"well-lit\" or has a distinctive color palette or a purposeful mise-en-scene, then I was thinking that those things are an unnecessary cost. Therefore, since moviemaking is a business, I would expect more films to favor incidental camera placement and natural/available light. Since they don't, I'm wondering what my knowledge/logic gap is. Which of the following may be true:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI overestimate the relative cost/time of lighting a set/location;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI underestimate the value that others place on the visual aesthetic;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLighting practices are vestiges of a time when inferior film technology necessitated massive lighting setups, and inertia has kept them around;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStudio contracts require the filling of potentially unnecessary positions (in part, because of option 3)?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the answers so far, my thinking is that at least the first three are true, with number 2 being the most important factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat other variables am I not accounting for?\u003c/p\u003e\n","is_answered":true,"view_count":5118,"tags":["production","cinematography","lighting"],"last_activity_date":1471042415,"answer_count":4,"creation_date":1470916287,"score":12,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/59047/are-lights-a-worthwhile-investment","accepted_answer_id":59067,"owner":{"user_id":39923,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d888ee34839d4b6d55ba80741ea7437d?s=128\u0026d=identicon\u0026r=PG","user_type":"registered","reputation":174,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/39923/tom","display_name":"Tom"},"title":"Are lights a worthwhile investment?","last_edit_date":1471042415,"question_id":59047}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":5336}

There's a scene where a man is tied up (I think to a chair) while another man sets up a deathtrap involving a punctured flour sack (my memory is of a paper sack which was punctured with a switchblade knife) that was set up so that it would fall and either pull over or knock over a lamp with an exposed incandescent bulb, causing it to fall into an open oven.

If I imagine the calculations that would be involved in adjusting motion blur in digital images by combining and splitting frames, it strikes me that it might not be possible without an exact reference frame for the background. Also, a mechanical shutter on a traditional camera could capture frames of any time length with correct results, but perhaps digital sensors are compelled to have \"shutter\" times which cannot be controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs this what's causing the choppy visual effect?

I either saw it on TV or Netflix but it isn't on the previously rented list on Netflix and I couldn't find it on imdb despite vigorous searching. The movie wasn't black and white or a musical, it was in English, it was live action, and I remember thinking the special effects were \"good\" but don't recall any scenes with special effects so I can't give detail. I remember very little so here's everything I can remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAladdin and Jafar head to the cave of wonders. Aladdin explores the cave, finds the lamp, and returns with it to the entrance. Jafar takes the lamp and kicks Aladdin back down as the cave's stairs collapse leaving Aladdin trapped inside. Aladdin rubs a magic ring that I think he already had (I want to say his brother gave it to him) which causes a genie to appear. The genie will grant 3 wishes and Aladdin uses the first to escape. He then returns to Agrabah to find that Jafar had used a wish to take over. Aladdin says that his second wish is to obtain the magic lamp to which the genie of the ring responds \"oh no, that's simply not possible. The genie of the lamp is much more powerful than I am\". So Aladdin instead wishes he was a prince and the plot goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the climax (I'm less sure about this part) Aladdin squares off against Jafar while both genies fight (which has a nice symmetry to it). The genie of the ring was simply trying not to die (since he knew he couldn't win). After Aladdin beats Jafar the genie of the lamp stops fighting and the genie of the ring is still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe genie of the ring had a very friendly personality: he wanted to be Aladdin's friend. The genie of the lamp on the other hand was very cold: he was only here to grant wishes (in fact I don't think he ever even talked). The genie of the ring was played by an actor (I want to say blue clothes) without special effects as opposed to the genie of the lamp who never had legs and was completely a special effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don't remember any actors or anything useful but since I couldn't find any movie description that mentioned a magic ring I'm going to guess that this is a fairly uniquely identifiable movie. After some google searching I found \u003ca href=\"https://dettoldisney.wordpress.com/2011/12/14/aladdin-vs-aladdin-and-the-enchanted-lamp/\"\u003ethis page\u003c/a\u003e which talks about the original Aladdin story. It says the original story did contain a genie in a magic ring which freed Aladdin from the cave. I didn't read much of the page but when I saw the part talking about exchanging old lamps for new I remembered a scene in this movie where Jasmine falls for this trick. Although I don't remember if it was Aladdin or Jafar in disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy inability to find this movie made me think that this was somehow a dream. But I've never read the Aladdin story and had only looked up details when trying to find this movie. So the few details I somehow knew of the original story makes me think that somebody must have made this movie based on the original story.

(Or, rather, I was recently reminded of a question that I had when it first came out, and that was never quite answered to my satisfaction.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo... personally, I was always disappointed that they chose not to include \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e of the \u003cstrong\u003elyrics\u003c/strong\u003e from the \"Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" (the opening number or any of its reprises). I kinda got why they wouldn't want it to be a chorus number, since they cut out or changed most of the libretto that required a chorus (I believe that there's an interview somewhere out there in which Tim Burton talks about how that was a conscious decision). And there were some lyrics in the \"Ballad\" that wouldn't quite have fit for a movie (e.g. \"What happened then, well that's the play/and he wouldn't want us to give it away\"). But for other songs - e.g. \"God, That's Good\" - they found ways to keep at least part of the song's lyrics, but just cut out the chorus or otherwise alter the song to make it fit for a chorus-less movie rather than a chorus-ful (so to speak) stage musical. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in other movies based on stage musicals, switching up lyrics so that they're more suitable for the medium (and sometimes for much less apparent reasons, but that's beside the point) seems to be the norm. The first example I can think of is \u003cem\u003eRent,\u003c/em\u003e which went through quite a lot of minor changes in its script and lyrics when it was adapted for the screen. For example, part of Collins' solo introducing Angel in the song \"Today 4 U\" was changed from \"Gentlemen, our benefactor on this Christmas Eve/whose charity is only matched by talent, I believe\" in the stage version to \"Gentlemen, our benefactor on this Christmas Day/whose charity is only matched by talent, I must say\" in the movie. (There are quite a few other examples, but you get the idea.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, as a musical theater nerd, I can't help but wonder (even with my personal disappointment aside), \u003cstrong\u003ewhy did Tim Burton and co. decide to \u003cem\u003ecompletely\u003c/em\u003e cut the lyrics from such an iconic song as \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" instead of just altering it? Was there a particular reason, or was it just a (relatively) \"random\" casualty of the song-slashing that always seems to happen when stage musicals are adapted for the screen?\u003c/strong\u003e (Maybe the Ballad isn't as iconic as I always thought it to be?)\u003c/p\u003e\n","is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"tags":["musical","adaptation","adaptation-differences","sweeney-todd"],"last_activity_date":1475508379,"answer_count":0,"creation_date":1474767030,"score":4,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/61145/why-did-tim-burton-cut-the-ballad-from-sweeney-todd","owner":{"user_id":22599,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZlpn.jpg?s=128\u0026g=1","user_type":"registered","reputation":2378,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/22599/ghostdog","accept_rate":88,"display_name":"ghostdog"},"title":"Why Did Tim Burton cut the Ballad from Sweeney Todd?","last_edit_date":1475508379,"question_id":61145}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":3239}

The chipmunks wore distinctive solid-color ankle-length sweaters. The follow-up, \u003cem\u003eAlvin and the Chipmunks\u003c/em\u003e (1983–1990), made the art style more detailed but kept the same sweaters. The 1987 animated film \u003cem\u003eThe Chipmunk Adventure\u003c/em\u003e used the same character designs as the 1980s series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt least four live-action movies followed starting in 2007, with a more realistic character design and size for the CGI chipmunks, lending a somewhat \u003cem\u003eChip 'n Dale\u003c/em\u003e look to their appearance.

How do I know it was a music room?  There was a microphone, a guitar, some drums, and possibly other equipment.  The kids were squabbling over who would do what.  Everyone in the scene was Caucasian and speaking American English.  The kids all looked around 11 or 12 to me, just barely not teenagers.

One girl with longish dark hair got to be the singer (microphone).  When she was singing she sounded really professional, but I half-thought the microphone had some capability like autotune.  The boy (who seemed like the youngest) got to play the guitar.  Finally they asked \"who will play the drums?\" and the father tried to convince the other girl (who had maybe shorter brown hair?) to do it.  She kept saying \"have you ever heard of a woman drummer?  No!\" but she did go over and sit at the drums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey all half-heartedly played a song together for a couple of lines (I don't remember which, but it was a well-known classic pop song) and then stopped.  The dad came back into the room and said \"Why don't I hear music coming from this room?\" and they complained \"Why won't you let us play?\", specifically using the word \"play\".  He said \"I let you play all you want, go ahead, play\" and the dark haired girl said something like \"No, not the instruments, I mean play outside, like run around\".  He kept insisting that they play more music for at least one hour.  They switched to arguing \"at least let us play newer music\".  One kid said \"Yeah, that song is from the 50s or something, it's old fashioned.\"  \"Let us play music we like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that's where I had to change the channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like the father was a recognizable actor, but I don't recall who.

I also noticed that my brain was often quicker reading the text from screen than understanding the audio.

Or is it in fact the other way round and some movies (actors) employ the language more heavily as an artistic way to shape characters, which might have been the case for CIA director Robert Dewey?

He told something like that ; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany years ago, there was a little kingdom in South Asia. The princess of the kingdom had loved a poor and unemployed guy.

Did you know that director Shane Carrurh wanted the objects to \u003cstrong\u003estay inside the box\u003c/strong\u003e when traveling back in time, so they keep their relative position in space? (remember that earth is moving so they need to challenge space as well as time, in order not to appear somewhere in outer space). In other words, they stay inside the box the whole \"times\", no matter \"when\" they pop out of it. The box keeps it's location on earth, and so are they. He mentioned Back To The Future where the DeLorean couldn't have possibly knew the location of which it needs to pop out at (?! sorry for my bad English, I hope this BTTF plot hole is understood). Carruth made a lot of efforts to untie any possible paradox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs many others, I've watched the movie quite a few times and read a lot of information about it. The following suggestion refers to the most common  analysis of Primer's timeline, and can be seen \u003ca href=\"http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/primer-chart-465x290.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is assumed that Aaron and Abe visit the party many times before making the successful move (where the gunman is arrested and Rachel is safe). But when you think about the mechanics, there seems to be a paradox:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to go back after a failed attempt (or just an observation) they must have a box running. But when they go back in time, in the new timeline \u003cstrong\u003etheir doubles are also going to the party to have their attempt\u003c/strong\u003e. Suppose the originals convince the doubles not to go, and let the originals go instead, since they have more experience. If they fail again this time, why would the doubles agree to stay in this timeline, where the party goes wrong? This implies both the originals and the doubles must go back together, which makes \u003cem\u003esum of series\u003c/em\u003e of doubles. Even if they stay in the hotel when the party is going, letting the ones that come out of the box to go there, there are still 2 sets of each person stuck there if they fail. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI can't think of any conventional way they could have loop over the party more then only one time. In this theory, they got it right the second time, and sent back the doubles with explicit orders of what to do. The originals would then stay in this timeline, \u003cstrong\u003eand these are the ones we see arguing at the airport\u003c/strong\u003e. It is possible that the doubles would fail and get stuck with the new doubles as explained above. In this scenario they will not get to the same airport scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf I squeeze the juice out of this theory, and add that 1) Aaron mentioned the term \"sum of series\" at the beginning of the film, and 2) considering the mindf**k scene at the end where he builds a huge machine, this could support the theory that they failed multiple times and are trying to fix it.

It was an USA made movie and probably first or second movie of the series. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a low budget movie. There wasn't any well-known actors or actresses and in fact there weren't many people in the whole movie. There was a married middle aged couple. I don't remember that they had any kids. The husband is about 35-40, medium sized, blonde and had hairstyle like Leonardo Dicaprio's in Titanic. His wife was 35-40, had long hair, short about 5'4 or 1.63m , dark eyes, white skin and medium weighted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe husband had a mistress but I couldn't remember her appearance. Probably younger and more attractive than his wife. They planned to kill the wife, because the husband thought that she wouldn't want to divorce and even if they got divorced, she wouldn't stop following them. They didn't think to kill her with any weapon or tool. They poisoned her to kill her without any evidence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a funeral scene and after that the couple took a vacation on the husband's boat on the ocean. When they were on the boat, there was a scene of rainy weather at the cemetery. The wife, who everybody thought dead, opened her eyes and tried to get out of the grave. She hadn't actually died. The poison that they gave her had slowed the rhythm of her heart, make her had a deep sleep and made very hard to notice her pulse by the paramedics/doctors. There was a similar scene in one of the episodes of the TV show 'Shameless'. The kids of Frank Gallagher gave him horse calmer and it showed him seem like he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, the movie continued on the boat. The couple were happy and sailing on the ocean. Suddenly the wife showed up on the boat. But the couple didn't see her as she was hiding from them. The mistress went to the kitchen and the wife knocked her out without much noise. She tied her up and kept waiting for the husband. The husband got curious after a while and also went to kitchen. I couldn't remember if he saw his wife or not but the wife also hit him and he passed out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small separate cabin in the boat that allowed people do deep-sea exploration without any diving equipment. It exists in boats designed for scientific research. The wife locked them in that cabin, sent them to the sea depths and cut the connection between the cabin and the boat. They were sinking in the deeper parts of the sea and after a short time they disappear. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI'm sure it was a series and there were at least 2 movies in the series. \u003c/p\u003e\n","is_answered":true,"view_count":767,"tags":["identify-this-movie"],"last_activity_date":1477590028,"answer_count":1,"creation_date":1477564616,"score":6,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/62441/a-movie-about-the-wife-taking-revenge-on-her-husband-and-his-mistress","accepted_answer_id":62447,"owner":{"user_id":40514,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8dc687bfadd2deb6a50589ef660473e2?s=128\u0026d=identicon\u0026r=PG\u0026f=1","user_type":"registered","reputation":312,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/40514/michael","accept_rate":100,"display_name":"michael"},"title":"A movie about the wife taking revenge on her husband and his mistress","last_edit_date":1477590028,"question_id":62441}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1942}

I watched it 3-4 years ago, so it shouldn't be newer than 2012. Unfortunately I watched it dubbed in my language, so I couldn't remember if it was USA made or not. But I can say it wasn't Asian, South American or Australian made. My best guess is it was a USA, Canada or Middle Europe made movie. The duration of the movie was about between 90 and 120 mins. It was a low budget movie, and the cast was about 10 teens aged 20-25, and a killer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e99% of the movie took place underground, except the last 1-2 minutes at the end. Another point is the time period in the movie is 5-6 hours, between midnight and the sunrise. At the beginning of the movie, there was a scene of the ending of a celebration at some underground place. It wasn't a club, bar, a place with security, bartender, DJ, etc. It was a small place, probably a basement of a building for just a group of friends having fun. Think about a standard high school stage. The area was about that big. There was a long rectangular desk with drinks, ice, etc. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the celebration was over, there were just about ten teens left. They were cleaning up the mess, and getting rid of decorations. Suddenly they figured out that one of their friends was missing. They thought that he was joking and tried to find him.

They tried to call the police but there was no signal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that scene they were panicked, separated and tried to escape from there. The exits were blocked, and the killer had cut the power. It was too dark and the only lights were Zippos, flashlights, phone lights, etc. The group was separated, and they tried to find a way out. There were lots of doors and halls in the basement.  He/She teased them by sending images of the bodies to the group. When they found the body, the killer had already escaped.

He is the one who reports to the higher ranked generals and he is in charge of everything that goes on there. How come he didn't knew that explosive charges were planted on the ship? The explosion, which was set to a specific time by a timer, apparently surprised him. And, if he was actually the one in charge of this -- how come he didn't consult with the two scientists which actually work on daily basis with the aliens and are literally on a verge of a huge discovery?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWho were the people who planted the charge? Who gave them this command? How come they let the scientist go into the ship, if there was an explosive charge there, set to explode in 10 minutes? All they said was something like - \u003cem\u003e\"no, you can't go there\"\u003c/em\u003e. This makes no sense.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the alien intentionally saved the two scientists by pushing them away? The obviously understood that something's wrong, because they started knocking on the \"glass\". Why did they actually wait for the explosion, if they about the charge?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow come no one made a big deal (or stop the explosion for instance) of the fact that Louise (Amy Adams) actually managed to draw, by hand, the aliens' symbols and made a huge progress (on the scientific and personal/psychological level) by doing that?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen Louise (Amy Adams) woke up, after this event -- nobody seems to really take the event seriously and investigate who have committed this act. This absolutely makes no sense -- that's probably the dumbest possible thing to do in their situation. They don't know which technology those aliens possess and what would be the reaction; they are in a middle of a study, regarding the reason of the aliens' arrival and their goals. (the reaction could be a beginning of a war with an unexplored species of aliens and obviously, the reaction would end the ongoing super import research which goes on around the world). The bottom line: how come no one made a big deal of this awfully stupid, irrational and unreasonable act.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhoever those people were, if they decided to start a war with a superior alien species -- why did they plant such a small amount of explosives, which definitely couldn't do anything to the ship (except annoying the aliens) instead of properly preparing for this attack?

I found it to be rich in substance as well as concept, all of which only bolstered by fine visuals and fine acting.

The scientists even pointed out that they tried playing aloud recordings of what they assumed would result in an attempt at communication, but the aliens chose to play recordings of the humans back, in an attempt to mimic their attempts of communication. This in itself proves that the visitors had an interest in bridging the language barrier and were attempting similar ideas, or at least were attempting ideas that they knew humans were familiar with, as we had tried the same. As well, they were visibly patient and had their intent been anything other than communication, I believe they would have already executed their plans for domination, trade, etc, on their own terms. The aliens in this film seemed to in fact allow themselves to be a blank canvas for the humans to hypothesise over, lowering their expectations of humanity to zero, allowing humans to work at their own pace. Unfortunately, the film proves that ‘our own pace’ is actually a fractured pace as we compete within our own species to solve the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, I may have digressed, but my question is- \u003cstrong\u003ewhy, when the visitors can view our world and that symbolic, written language is widely used and understood, would they not attempt an exchange of written language from the beginning\u003c/strong\u003e?

I believe he is trying to find something in his partner that is exclusive to him and his partner (short-sightedness) hence he grows insecure of the other man who brings his partner rabbits as he tries to find out if he is short-sighted too and in the process nearly injures him and calms down upon finding out that that is not the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEver since she has gone blind it seems like the passion in their relationship is gone as if they can't communicate (the scene in the movie when she asks him if he wants to play more games or if he would visit her in the morning and he fails to do so) it seems like they have lost touch as if there is something missing and in the end he tries to blind himself too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think on a deeper level all of this is a metaphor for how when we are in a relationship we try to see the world or make sense of things around us from a common perspective.

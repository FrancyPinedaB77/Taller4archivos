Action is often shot at 22fps and played back at 24fps, for example. I guess that's what's happening here, but there seem to be some caveats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you look at the famous intro sequence from Saving Private Ryan, one trick Spielberg used was to shoot it as 12fps to imitate the cameras which actually caught battle footage in WW2. This contributes to the frenetic tone of the scene, but the images still seem \"smooth\" in a way that CA:CW does not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think the issue might be that CA:CW is lacking motion blur, as if it was shot at 60fps and 2/3rds of the frames were thrown away, or something like that. If I imagine the calculations that would be involved in adjusting motion blur in digital images by combining and splitting frames, it strikes me that it might not be possible without an exact reference frame for the background. Also, a mechanical shutter on a traditional camera could capture frames of any time length with correct results, but perhaps digital sensors are compelled to have \"shutter\" times which cannot be controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs this what's causing the choppy visual effect?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5831d384aee0e60eeb126c79"},"has_more":false,"items":[{"body":"\u003cp\u003eI recall seeing an Aladdin movie (not the \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103639/\"\u003eobvious Disney one\u003c/a\u003e) a few years back (more than 3 but I'm unsure of when). I either saw it on TV or Netflix but it isn't on the previously rented list on Netflix and I couldn't find it on imdb despite vigorous searching. The movie wasn't black and white or a musical, it was in English, it was live action, and I remember thinking the special effects were \"good\" but don't recall any scenes with special effects so I can't give detail. I remember very little so here's everything I can remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAladdin and Jafar head to the cave of wonders. Aladdin explores the cave, finds the lamp, and returns with it to the entrance. Jafar takes the lamp and kicks Aladdin back down as the cave's stairs collapse leaving Aladdin trapped inside. Aladdin rubs a magic ring that I think he already had (I want to say his brother gave it to him) which causes a genie to appear. The genie will grant 3 wishes and Aladdin uses the first to escape. He then returns to Agrabah to find that Jafar had used a wish to take over. Aladdin says that his second wish is to obtain the magic lamp to which the genie of the ring responds \"oh no, that's simply not possible. The genie of the lamp is much more powerful than I am\". So Aladdin instead wishes he was a prince and the plot goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the climax (I'm less sure about this part) Aladdin squares off against Jafar while both genies fight (which has a nice symmetry to it). The genie of the ring was simply trying not to die (since he knew he couldn't win). After Aladdin beats Jafar the genie of the lamp stops fighting and the genie of the ring is still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe genie of the ring had a very friendly personality: he wanted to be Aladdin's friend. The genie of the lamp on the other hand was very cold: he was only here to grant wishes (in fact I don't think he ever even talked). The genie of the ring was played by an actor (I want to say blue clothes) without special effects as opposed to the genie of the lamp who never had legs and was completely a special effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don't remember any actors or anything useful but since I couldn't find any movie description that mentioned a magic ring I'm going to guess that this is a fairly uniquely identifiable movie. After some google searching I found \u003ca href=\"https://dettoldisney.wordpress.com/2011/12/14/aladdin-vs-aladdin-and-the-enchanted-lamp/\"\u003ethis page\u003c/a\u003e which talks about the original Aladdin story. It says the original story did contain a genie in a magic ring which freed Aladdin from the cave. I didn't read much of the page but when I saw the part talking about exchanging old lamps for new I remembered a scene in this movie where Jasmine falls for this trick. Although I don't remember if it was Aladdin or Jafar in disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy inability to find this movie made me think that this was somehow a dream. But I've never read the Aladdin story and had only looked up details when trying to find this movie. So the few details I somehow knew of the original story makes me think that somebody must have made this movie based on the original story. Perhaps this was a lesser known movie made for TV (like SciFi movies).

(Or, rather, I was recently reminded of a question that I had when it first came out, and that was never quite answered to my satisfaction.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo... personally, I was always disappointed that they chose not to include \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e of the \u003cstrong\u003elyrics\u003c/strong\u003e from the \"Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" (the opening number or any of its reprises). I kinda got why they wouldn't want it to be a chorus number, since they cut out or changed most of the libretto that required a chorus (I believe that there's an interview somewhere out there in which Tim Burton talks about how that was a conscious decision). And there were some lyrics in the \"Ballad\" that wouldn't quite have fit for a movie (e.g. \"What happened then, well that's the play/and he wouldn't want us to give it away\"). But for other songs - e.g. \"God, That's Good\" - they found ways to keep at least part of the song's lyrics, but just cut out the chorus or otherwise alter the song to make it fit for a chorus-less movie rather than a chorus-ful (so to speak) stage musical. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in other movies based on stage musicals, switching up lyrics so that they're more suitable for the medium (and sometimes for much less apparent reasons, but that's beside the point) seems to be the norm. The first example I can think of is \u003cem\u003eRent,\u003c/em\u003e which went through quite a lot of minor changes in its script and lyrics when it was adapted for the screen. For example, part of Collins' solo introducing Angel in the song \"Today 4 U\" was changed from \"Gentlemen, our benefactor on this Christmas Eve/whose charity is only matched by talent, I believe\" in the stage version to \"Gentlemen, our benefactor on this Christmas Day/whose charity is only matched by talent, I must say\" in the movie. (There are quite a few other examples, but you get the idea.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, as a musical theater nerd, I can't help but wonder (even with my personal disappointment aside), \u003cstrong\u003ewhy did Tim Burton and co. decide to \u003cem\u003ecompletely\u003c/em\u003e cut the lyrics from such an iconic song as \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" instead of just altering it? Was there a particular reason, or was it just a (relatively) \"random\" casualty of the song-slashing that always seems to happen when stage musicals are adapted for the screen?\u003c/strong\u003e (Maybe the Ballad isn't as iconic as I always thought it to be?)\u003c/p\u003e\n","is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"tags":["musical","adaptation","adaptation-differences","sweeney-todd"],"last_activity_date":1475508379,"answer_count":0,"creation_date":1474767030,"score":4,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/61145/why-did-tim-burton-cut-the-ballad-from-sweeney-todd","owner":{"user_id":22599,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZlpn.jpg?s=128\u0026g=1","user_type":"registered","reputation":2378,"link":"http://movies.stackexchange.com/users/22599/ghostdog","accept_rate":88,"display_name":"ghostdog"},"title":"Why Did Tim Burton cut the Ballad from Sweeney Todd?","last_edit_date":1475508379,"question_id":61145}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":3239,"entidades":[{"PERSON":[{"p0":"Tim Burton"},{"p2":"Stephen Sondheim"},{"p4":"Tim Burton"},{"p6":"Collins"},{"p7":"Tim Burton"}]},{"LOCATION":[{"y0":"Ballad"}]},{"DATE":[]},{"ORGANIZATION":[{"l0":"Sweeney"},{"l1":"Todd"}]},{"MONEY":[]},{"TIME":[]}]}

She goes to the modeling agencies and photo agencies for this dream. She was white, with black hair and eyebrows, tall about 5'7'' or 1.70 m, between 18-23, had a curvy body like the stars at that time. She met one of the big boss's in the town and he told her to do something very different in order to shine and offered being a nude model. She surprised about this offer but accepted it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe was taken some nude photos and the boss wanted to advertise this. He spread the news to the journalists.

They took lots of photos and asked many questions about her age, hometown, education, family, dreams, career goals, etc. One of the photographers asked her to turn around and she did it. She had an underwear but it didn't cover much of her body. They laughed, took pictures and expressed their greeting to meet her butt. They made articles about her in their newspapers and magazines. She become popular in a very short time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remember a scene that between her and a photographer. He had some feelings but he never expressed it to her.

He started to take topless photos of her. Suddenly he asked her to as if she can remove the underwear and she accepted it. He took bunch of photos in a close range. After that he told her, if he shoot too many nude photos, his boss would question him. Plus he said that he couldn't publish all of them. She confirmed that and put back her underwear. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEventually she became a celebrity and had a long career.

The follow-up, \u003cem\u003eAlvin and the Chipmunks\u003c/em\u003e (1983–1990), made the art style more detailed but kept the same sweaters. The 1987 animated film \u003cem\u003eThe Chipmunk Adventure\u003c/em\u003e used the same character designs as the 1980s series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt least four live-action movies followed starting in 2007, with a more realistic character design and size for the CGI chipmunks, lending a somewhat \u003cem\u003eChip 'n Dale\u003c/em\u003e look to their appearance.

How do I know it was a music room?  There was a microphone, a guitar, some drums, and possibly other equipment.  The kids were squabbling over who would do what.  Everyone in the scene was Caucasian and speaking American English.  The kids all looked around 11 or 12 to me, just barely not teenagers.  For some reason I felt like the movie was set in the 70s or so, from the way people were dressed, although I don't have any specific details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two girls and a boy.  One girl with longish dark hair got to be the singer (microphone).  When she was singing she sounded really professional, but I half-thought the microphone had some capability like autotune.  The boy (who seemed like the youngest) got to play the guitar.  Finally they asked \"who will play the drums?\" and the father tried to convince the other girl (who had maybe shorter brown hair?) to do it.  She kept saying \"have you ever heard of a woman drummer?  No!\" but she did go over and sit at the drums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey all half-heartedly played a song together for a couple of lines (I don't remember which, but it was a well-known classic pop song) and then stopped.  The dad came back into the room and said \"Why don't I hear music coming from this room?\" and they complained \"Why won't you let us play?\", specifically using the word \"play\".  He said \"I let you play all you want, go ahead, play\" and the dark haired girl said something like \"No, not the instruments, I mean play outside, like run around\".

The girl looked like she was around 8-12 years old with brown or black hair. I believe she was an orphan as well but certain. I don't remember her having any parents or family. I think the last scene was of her hugging 'Artemis' under a tall old bare tree. I think 'Artemis' looked sort of like a large version of when Remus Lupin turned into a werewolf in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. \nPlease help identify this movie!

I often found myself being able to follow the plot, but \u003cstrong\u003enot necessarily understanding every word of the spoken language\u003c/strong\u003e. I also noticed that my brain was often quicker reading the text from screen than understanding the audio. What I understood from the English audio was never that far off, but I clearly missed a few catch phrases. I found that Tommy Lee Jones's character was especially hard to understand.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow I wonder if I was really able to follow Taken 2 that easily or if I was simply not aware of which phrases I missed to understand due to the lack of subtitles. Or is it in fact the other way round and some movies (actors) employ the language more heavily as an artistic way to shape characters, which might have been the case for CIA director Robert Dewey? For example, I heard that Leonardo DiCaprio got some praise for the accent he gave his character in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Diamond_(film)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlood Diamond\u003c/a\u003e, which made me shy away from watching that movie in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal would be to not only be able to follow the plot at ease, but also catch the fine details of dialogue and language that were purposefully inserted by the artists that crafted the movie.

Did you know that director Shane Carrurh wanted the objects to \u003cstrong\u003estay inside the box\u003c/strong\u003e when traveling back in time, so they keep their relative position in space? (remember that earth is moving so they need to challenge space as well as time, in order not to appear somewhere in outer space). In other words, they stay inside the box the whole \"times\", no matter \"when\" they pop out of it. The box keeps it's location on earth, and so are they. He mentioned Back To The Future where the DeLorean couldn't have possibly knew the location of which it needs to pop out at (?! sorry for my bad English, I hope this BTTF plot hole is understood). Carruth made a lot of efforts to untie any possible paradox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs many others, I've watched the movie quite a few times and read a lot of information about it. The following suggestion refers to the most common  analysis of Primer's timeline, and can be seen \u003ca href=\"http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/primer-chart-465x290.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is assumed that Aaron and Abe visit the party many times before making the successful move (where the gunman is arrested and Rachel is safe). But when you think about the mechanics, there seems to be a paradox:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to go back after a failed attempt (or just an observation) they must have a box running. But when they go back in time, in the new timeline \u003cstrong\u003etheir doubles are also going to the party to have their attempt\u003c/strong\u003e. Suppose the originals convince the doubles not to go, and let the originals go instead, since they have more experience. If they fail again this time, why would the doubles agree to stay in this timeline, where the party goes wrong? This implies both the originals and the doubles must go back together, which makes \u003cem\u003esum of series\u003c/em\u003e of doubles. Even if they stay in the hotel when the party is going, letting the ones that come out of the box to go there, there are still 2 sets of each person stuck there if they fail. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI can't think of any conventional way they could have loop over the party more then only one time. In this theory, they got it right the second time, and sent back the doubles with explicit orders of what to do. The originals would then stay in this timeline, \u003cstrong\u003eand these are the ones we see arguing at the airport\u003c/strong\u003e. It is possible that the doubles would fail and get stuck with the new doubles as explained above. In this scenario they will not get to the same airport scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf I squeeze the juice out of this theory, and add that 1) Aaron mentioned the term \"sum of series\" at the beginning of the film, and 2) considering the mindf**k scene at the end where he builds a huge machine, this could support the theory that they failed multiple times and are trying to fix it.

It was an USA made movie and probably first or second movie of the series. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a low budget movie. There wasn't any well-known actors or actresses and in fact there weren't many people in the whole movie. There was a married middle aged couple. I don't remember that they had any kids. The husband is about 35-40, medium sized, blonde and had hairstyle like Leonardo Dicaprio's in Titanic. His wife was 35-40, had long hair, short about 5'4 or 1.63m , dark eyes, white skin and medium weighted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe husband had a mistress but I couldn't remember her appearance. Probably younger and more attractive than his wife. They planned to kill the wife, because the husband thought that she wouldn't want to divorce and even if they got divorced, she wouldn't stop following them. They didn't think to kill her with any weapon or tool. They poisoned her to kill her without any evidence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a funeral scene and after that the couple took a vacation on the husband's boat on the ocean. When they were on the boat, there was a scene of rainy weather at the cemetery. The wife, who everybody thought dead, opened her eyes and tried to get out of the grave. She hadn't actually died. The poison that they gave her had slowed the rhythm of her heart, make her had a deep sleep and made very hard to notice her pulse by the paramedics/doctors. There was a similar scene in one of the episodes of the TV show 'Shameless'. The kids of Frank Gallagher gave him horse calmer and it showed him seem like he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, the movie continued on the boat. The couple were happy and sailing on the ocean. Suddenly the wife showed up on the boat. But the couple didn't see her as she was hiding from them. The mistress went to the kitchen and the wife knocked her out without much noise. She tied her up and kept waiting for the husband. The husband got curious after a while and also went to kitchen. I couldn't remember if he saw his wife or not but the wife also hit him and he passed out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small separate cabin in the boat that allowed people do deep-sea exploration without any diving equipment. It exists in boats designed for scientific research. The wife locked them in that cabin, sent them to the sea depths and cut the connection between the cabin and the boat.

I watched it 3-4 years ago, so it shouldn't be newer than 2012. Unfortunately I watched it dubbed in my language, so I couldn't remember if it was USA made or not. But I can say it wasn't Asian, South American or Australian made. My best guess is it was a USA, Canada or Middle Europe made movie. The duration of the movie was about between 90 and 120 mins. It was a low budget movie, and the cast was about 10 teens aged 20-25, and a killer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e99% of the movie took place underground, except the last 1-2 minutes at the end. Another point is the time period in the movie is 5-6 hours, between midnight and the sunrise. At the beginning of the movie, there was a scene of the ending of a celebration at some underground place. It wasn't a club, bar, a place with security, bartender, DJ, etc. It was a small place, probably a basement of a building for just a group of friends having fun. Think about a standard high school stage. The area was about that big. There was a long rectangular desk with drinks, ice, etc. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the celebration was over, there were just about ten teens left. They were cleaning up the mess, and getting rid of decorations. Suddenly they figured out that one of their friends was missing. They thought that he was joking and tried to find him. One of the girls found the body and screamed. The others ran toward the screams, and were shocked when they found the body. They tried to call the police but there was no signal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that scene they were panicked, separated and tried to escape from there. The exits were blocked, and the killer had cut the power. It was too dark and the only lights were Zippos, flashlights, phone lights, etc. The group was separated, and they tried to find a way out. There were lots of doors and halls in the basement.  He/She teased them by sending images of the bodies to the group. When they found the body, the killer had already escaped. It continued like that while he/she killed the teens one by one until finally only 2 teens were left.

The explosion, which was set to a specific time by a timer, apparently surprised him.

I found it to be rich in substance as well as concept, all of which only bolstered by fine visuals and fine acting.

The scientists even pointed out that they tried playing aloud recordings of what they assumed would result in an attempt at communication, but the aliens chose to play recordings of the humans back, in an attempt to mimic their attempts of communication. This in itself proves that the visitors had an interest in bridging the language barrier and were attempting similar ideas, or at least were attempting ideas that they knew humans were familiar with, as we had tried the same. As well, they were visibly patient and had their intent been anything other than communication, I believe they would have already executed their plans for domination, trade, etc, on their own terms. The aliens in this film seemed to in fact allow themselves to be a blank canvas for the humans to hypothesise over, lowering their expectations of humanity to zero, allowing humans to work at their own pace.

I think that tells me that he is trying to find common ground with a potential partner. Similarly, later on he seems to be fixated on the short-sightedness of Rachel Weiss's character. I believe he is trying to find something in his partner that is exclusive to him and his partner (short-sightedness) hence he grows insecure of the other man who brings his partner rabbits as he tries to find out if he is short-sighted too and in the process nearly injures him and calms down upon finding out that that is not the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEver since she has gone blind it seems like the passion in their relationship is gone as if they can't communicate (the scene in the movie when she asks him if he wants to play more games or if he would visit her in the morning and he fails to do so) it seems like they have lost touch as if there is something missing and in the end he tries to blind himself too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think on a deeper level all of this is a metaphor for how when we are in a relationship we try to see the world or make sense of things around us from a common perspective.

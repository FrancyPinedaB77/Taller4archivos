His memory is in tact, but he often lies to Leonard to manipulate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo there is a dilemma, the narration of the film is unreliable and contradictory. It is also shown out of order to further complicate matters. Fortunately, there is an Easter egg hidden in the DVD release which will allow you to watch it in chronological order. While this doesn't explain everything, we can more easily see how everything fits together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul's answer is partially correct, but has some details wrong. According to Teddy, Leonard often lies to himself to make him feel better. Teddy states that Sammy Jenkis was in fact a real person, but Leonard has the story mixed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeonard did investigate Sammy's case, and believed he was a fraud. Sammy was in a car accident where he suffered a head injury. Leonard believed he was lying because Sammy would act like he recognized him when he came to the door. What Leonard did not realize at the time is that Sammy faked responses to act more normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Leonard's memories of Sammy's case, he had a wife that was a diabetic. Sammy's wife would routinely test his memory by hiding objects all over the house, and then she would try to get him to remember where he had left them. The strange thing about his injury is that he still was able to do complex tasks such as give his wife insulin. Since he had learned how to do that before the injury, he could still perform it. Now, his wife had become very depressed for some reason (we will get to that in a bit). One day, she tried in vain to get him to remember. She would call him repeatedly and have him do the insulin injection. Since Sammy could reliably perform this task, he did it every time she asked him to. Eventually, he gave her so much insulin that she fatally overdosed. Sammy was never able to fully reconcile what he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Teddy, Sammy actually had no wife. Sammy was real, but the story Leonard tells about him was not true. It was Leonard's wife that was diabetic, and it was Leonard that unwittingly killed her. Leonard's wife was also very depressed. Not only was she depressed about her husband, she was also depressed because of the attack. Whether or not she committed suicide is completely up for debate, but it was clear that she was not happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe psychology behind Leonard's character is very complex. He was diagnosed with a form of amnesia called anterograde amnesia. People with this form of amnesia have difficulty creating new memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAnterograde amnesia is a loss of the ability to create new memories after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe also appears to have some other undiagnosed symptoms. Leonard also shows signs of having an illness called prosopagnosia, commonly known as face blindness. Prosopagnosia can also be caused by a brain injury, and it is likely he is also suffering from a form of it called associative prosopagnosia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAssociative prosopagnosia has typically been used to describe cases of acquired prosopagnosia  ... People with this form of the disorder may be able to see whether photos of people's faces are the same or different and derive the age and sex from a face (suggesting they can make sense of some face information) but may not be able to subsequently identify the person or provide any information about them such as their name, occupation, or when they were last encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis fact was alluded to due to the fact that he could look at a picture, and compare it to someone, but he cannot associate that image with any of his memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only truth was at the end when Teddy confessed to Leonard, and he told him what really happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Does Leonard really have memories before the incident?","tags":["plot-explanation","memento"],"score":2,"question_id":60156,"answer_id":60942},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eLeonard is the classic unreliable narrator; and he even warns us of this when he tells us that memories cannot be trusted, that they can be distorted.

At the end of the film when Teddy tries to force Leonard to remember we return to this scene, only this time, when a nurse walks past, we briefly see that it is Leonard. The scene quickly returns to it being Sammy. The inference is that Leonard has, just for a moment, remembered the truth.

And, as Leonard explains, he can't ever process his grief (and guilt) over his wife's death because the memory of doing so doesn't stick.

However, it turned out at that point that the production rights and distribution rights on the Hobbit were owned by different parties. To the best of my knowledge they decided to continue solely with Lord Of The Rings afterwards. This project went through quite some production hell (going from 2 movies to 1 to almost none to 3). Only after the extreme success of those movies the team started looking at the Hobbit again. That also took some time because first those rights had to be obtained and secondly there were some legal struggles between Jackson and New Line Cinemas. However, eventually everything was settled and the films were also made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow the following is more subjective, but as you mentioned the digitial effects specifically, I want to comment on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople tends to overestimate the role of technology and technology evolution. First of all, technology evolution is relatively limited, most computer rendering methods are already quite old. For example, ray tracing was developed late 60's/early 70's. Recent evolution only provides a few things on top of that: more processing power (and memory) and improved tools. In the end it depends at least as much on the skill of the artist how good the results look, and together with that also on how much time they're given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first is for cinema actually less of an issue, as there is no need to render frames in real time, so whether one has to wait 1minute or 1 day for a final, production frame to render is not important (for big budget productions). Same goes for memory, it mainly makes it go faster, but if you don't have enough RAM nothing stops you from rendering from (a set of) SDD/HDD's.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is more important, because better tools (should) save time. Suppose for example you are working on a render of a forest. If you have a tool that's optimized to generate quite realistic vegetation as a start, you'll be up to speed a lot faster than when you have to design everything from scratch. If the tool also provides a way to model a breeze through that vegetation, then your animation task also becomes easier, etc. etc. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for LOTR specifically Weta Digital created those tools themselves, most famous example (also mentioned in the question): they needed to model huge armies so they made a tool for that called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASSIVE_(software)\"\u003eMASSIVE\u003c/a\u003e, which was later actually reused to do some of the work on Avatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, don't underestimate how much 'special effects' in Lord of the Rings and even more recent movies is done using good old props. For Lord of the rings this was again done by Weta. Here CGI technology evolution would again have little to no impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo in the end it seems unlikely that the more than 10 years of technological advantage would have made a huge difference for lord of the rings. Some for sure, but probably not worth the wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why did Peter Jackson direct the Lord of the Rings first and then The Hobbit?","tags":["the-lord-of-the-rings","the-hobbit"],"score":11,"question_id":60344,"answer_id":60346}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":4656,"entidades":1.0}

The animal’s left foreleg is tied up, and the trainer stands on the left side of the horse and gently pulls him off balance by pulling the right rein over the saddle. The trainer repeats the process daily until the horse learns the rein cue and no longer needs to have his leg tied. The trainer then teaches the horse to fall with a rider.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\"The training is very specialized and not just anyone can do it,” says Mitchum. \"It requires extreme patience and confidence, and the ability to read the horse and know what it is capable of, and when to push and when to back off.

One inflected form would be gollum (gold, treasure,\n  something precious). Another hypothesis is that Tolkien got the name Gollum from the\n  Jewish Golem.

Wanda soon discovers that both she and her father are\n  believed to be spies planning an invasion of Atlantis. During her\n  adventures, Wanda's appearance changes from nerdy to attractive (by\n  removing her glasses and using a steam vent to clean her skin). People\n  from the surface world are referred to as \"aliens\" by Atlanteans, who\n  appear virtually identical to surface dwellers, and when Wanda is\n  overheard talking about Malibu Beach by a low-life informant (Janie Du\n  Plessis), she soon becomes a hunted woman and must dodge efforts at\n  capture, both from the mysterious \"Government House\" and from thugs in\n  the pay of the crime lord Mambino (Deep Roy).

And I thought, well, that seems like a clear marker\n  for me, that Steve laid in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ending of the movie of course fits into a certain tradition:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWhen that came to me, \u003cstrong\u003eit just felt like the kind of Twilight Zone\n  ending that really stays with you\u003c/strong\u003e. You know, “Time Enough at Last”\n  where Burgess Meredith breaks his glasses — that kind of ending, where\n  you’re like “Oh no, if he’d only waited two more minutes!” I liked the\n  horrendous irony of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was also fueled by Darabont's own feelings:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAt that time, I was feeling a little bit\n  pissed off at the world. There’s definitely a political element to\n  that movie, which you don’t have to look too hard to see. Though it’s\n  not a political movie, it’s in many ways a very political movie. \u003cstrong\u003eI was\n  feeling a little angry at the world, and at our country at that time\u003c/strong\u003e\n  [The Mist was released in 2007], \u003cstrong\u003eso it felt like a valid way to end a\n  movie\u003c/strong\u003e. It doesn’t always have to be a happy ending. It shouldn’t\n  always be a happy ending. Having grown up in the ’70s, it wasn’t\n  always a happy ending.

If Stephen King\n  reads my script and says, ‘Dude, what are you doing, are you out of\n  your mind? You can’t end my story this way,’ then I would actually not\n  have made the movie.” But \u003cstrong\u003ehe read it and said, “Oh, I love this\n  ending. I wish I’d thought of it.” He said that, once a generation, a\n  movie should come along that just really pisses the audience off, and\n  flips their expectations of a happy ending right on the head.\u003c/strong\u003e He\n  pointed to the original Night of the Living Dead as one of those\n  endings that just scarred you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"Did Stephen King like Frank Darabont\u0026#39;s ending of \u0026quot;The Mist\u0026quot;?","tags":["reception","the-mist"],"score":14,"question_id":61171,"answer_id":61172}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":3828,"entidades":1.0}

(The same is true of the comics, for what it's worth.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer answer is: there was only ever one Barry Allen. What changed was Barry Allen's life from 2000 to 2016. There have now been four versions of Barry's life history\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the \u003cem\u003eoriginal\u003c/em\u003e original timeline, Barry grew up with a mom and dad, and eventually became the Flash sometime around 2020.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the Season 1 timeline, distant-future-Thawne travels back to 2000 and kills Barry's mom. He then impersonates Harrison Well's and makes Barry into The Flash in 2014.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the \"Flashpoint\" timeline, 2016-Barry-Allen travels back to 2000 and stops distant-future-Thawne from killing Nora Allen. He then returns back to 2016. In this timeline, young Barry Allen slept through the whole mess, and grows up with both parents, but somehow still has his Speed Force powers by 2016.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the post-\"Flashpoint\" timeline, 2016-Barry-Allen travels back to 2000 to stop distant-future-Thawne from killing Nora, then travels back \u003cem\u003ea second time\u003c/em\u003e to \"fix\" his mistake. This Barry we know very little about, presumably we'll figure it out as the season unfolds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote that 2000 \"child\" Barry Allen always grows up until 2016 \"adult\" Barry Allen in every timeline, and he always gets his powers in every timeline. The difference is what his childhood is like during that 16 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's also important to note that, as a Speedster, Barry (and Thawne) have some degree of \u003cem\u003enatural\u003c/em\u003e immunity to time paradoxes, because of their access to the Speed Force.  This is why, for example, they both remember the previous timeline when no one else does. It also explains how Nora's still alive, if Barry never knew he needed to go back and save her from Thawne, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as we are told, young Barry grew up not knowing there was anything odd about his life, right up until he reached the point in the timeline where Season 2 Barry \"comes back\", and from then forward he has his Season 2 memories. As the episode goes on, it appears as if \"new\" Barry's memories are starting to replace \"previous\" Barry's memories.

If you were never immersed into an English environment, you will have to learn it as you watch the movie (hard to do).\u003cbr\u003e\n- The education level of the dialog will directly bear on how much you comprehend.\u003cbr\u003e\n- The speed with which the characters speak will determine how much you get.\u003cbr\u003e\n- The action in the plot will determine whether you can follow the plot without the needs for words.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Understanding song is much harder.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I found that works (if you are interested in understanding the whole movie, just watching it again, and/or learning more English):\u003cbr\u003e\n- See the movie dubbed in your native language. If they did a good job dubbing, you will get the entertainment value, and you may decide it's worth it to watch again.\u003cbr\u003e\n- See the movie in the language it was filmed in, preferable in a format that you can rewind.  Now enjoy it as much as you like.  Watching with a friend will help.\u003cbr\u003e\n- If there is song, read the lyrics/libretto beforehand. \u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How to get started watching English movies as a non native speaker?","tags":["dialogue","dubbing"],"score":5,"question_id":61630,"answer_id":61633}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":3369,"entidades":1.0}

Forever. (Rose realizes how bleak a prospect this is for her)\" Cameron left that out of the final cut.

In fact Ferris was the one who pretended to be the doctor who seemingly gets shot in the beginning of the story.  And while pretending to be the doctor, he has an allergic reaction to the bonding agent used in the fake beard, and the allergic reaction causes symptoms that makes Langdon suspect that Ferris is the carrier of the virus.  In any case, Ferris is directed by the Consortium to hand Langdon and Sienna over to the WHO, so to escape Sienna makes it seem that Ferris is having a heart attack and she's performing CPR on him, when really she is incapacitating him.  In any case, by the end of the novel Ferris is fine and he explains everything to Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the movie Jonathan Ferris is replaced by a black guy named Christoph Bouchard, who really is a WHO agent and not a Consortium actor at all.  In fact the Consortium actor who plays the doctor in the beginning plays no further role in the movie.  In any case, in the movie Bouchard is a corrupt WHO agent who is trying to sell the Inferno virus to the highest bidder.  He is killed by the Provost of the Consortium, which brings me to the second difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Consortium is far more violent in the movie than in the book.  In the book, Langdon calls the U.S. Embassy but he's really talking to a Consortium person.  And them Vayentha is sent to the hotel across the street in order to make Langdon think the U.S. government is after him, to build trust between Langdon and Sienna so that Langdon will solve the puzzle for Sienna.    But the Consortium's plan goes awry when Langdon accesses his email account from Sienna's laptop, which causes the WHO to find out his location.  When the Provost finds out that the WHO is coming, he decides to abort the operation.  In any case, when Vayentha points a gun at Langdon when they're atop the scaffold, she was planning to shoot the gun at him to show him that it only fires blanks and this was all a deception.  So Sienna kills Vayentha in order to prevent her from revealing the truth, all the while pretending that she was saving Langdon's life from Vayentha.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the movie, after Langdon and Sienna flee the apartment, the Provost issues a kill order for Langdon, which is something that the book's version of the Consortium would never do since they're just an acting troop.  (Although Vayentha does worry in the book that the Provost might have her killed.)  In any case, in the scaffold scene in the movie Vayentha has a real gun with bullets, and Sienna really does save Langdon's life from Vayentha.  Also, in the movie the Provost is a much more violent guy, someone who has a collection of weird-shaped knives which he uses when needed.  Finally, I think in the movie the Provost may have been killed in the end, whereas in the book he's arrested for the role he played in helping Zobrist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eSiena's character is changed significantly in the movie.  In the book, although Langdon and the WHO think that Sienna is trying to release the virus, in reality she's just trying to get to it first in order to destroy it.  She doesn't trust the WHO to destroy it since the government might want to preserve it as a biological weapon.  In the movie, she's blind follower of Zobrist who really does want to release the virus, and she closes the window on Langdon in Venice so she can release the virus in Istanbul.  And in the movie she's ultimately killed while trying to release the virus.  Whereas in the book, she survives and she plans to become an advocate for keeping the effects of the virus as they are.  Which brings me to the next difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe nature of the virus is dramatically changed in the movie.  In the book, everyone including Sienna assumes the virus is lethal, but in reality what it does is it renders a third of the Earth's population infertile, in order to solve the\nproblem of overpopulation.  In the movie, the virus really is lethal, and there's a big fight scene at the end where it's prevented from being released.  In the book, the virus is actually released, in fact Zobrist released it a week earlier and it just took a week to spread over the world.

The Consortium is portrayed as a sinister spy organization for a very long time, and it's only at the end that it's revealed to be an acting troupe.  In the movie the acting troupe revelation is a minor plot twist.  Also, the movie reveals right in the beginning that the agents chasing Langdon work for the World Health Organization, whereas in the book they're portrayed as mysterious agents wearing green medallions and their true identity is only revealed when they capture Langdon.  Finally, there's a long segment of the book where it seems like Jonathan Ferris (the equivalent of Cristoph Bouchard) is working for Zobrist, whereas in the movie the audience only thinks that for a small amount of time during the train scene and its aftermath, before it's revealed that he's motivated by greed.  In the book it's only at the very end that it's revealed that Ferris works for the Consortium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe movie adds a whole past relationship between Robert Langdon and s WHO director which is completely absent in the book.

Some books don't translate well to the screen, but in this case I think a more faithful adaptation would have done much better in the box office and with critics.  The whole element of keeping the audience fooled might have made this into a Christopher Nolan-like movie with a mind-blowing twist at the end.  Instead they decided to make it a standard Hollywood action movie.  Dan Brown's other novels are pretty formulaic and fit better with the standard action movie plot, but Inferno was in my opinion Dan Brown's most creative novel.

It's the tvs that are applying an effect. Let me explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo fool the human brain into believing that a series of flashes are a continuous, moving image, the flashes have to come at a minimum of between 50-60 Hz (cycles per second). The chemicals available in the early days of motion picture film simply weren't fast enough to get a good exposure at that speed--and it would have taken a LOT of film. (In 35mm, that's almost 1.5 meters of film going through the camera every second!) It was realized that you could cheat by flashing the same frame multiple times. Standard motion picture film, though only shot at 24 frames per second, sits behind a spinning shutter that looks something like a radiation symbol: As it spins, it flashes each frame three times: 3*24=72 Hz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen video came along, it used a different method of cheating. Video cameras would record (and tvs would play back) every other line of an image, alternating between even and odd at (in North America) 59.94 Hz. This means that effectively tv was playing back motion at ~60Hz, rather than flashing the same frame 3 times. It's a subtle effect, but it's one that our brains can sort-of detect: The motion in a native video image is \"sharper\" than film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eModern HD tvs can display full frames of video at 60 Hz. To show off this feature, some \u003cstrike\u003eidiot\u003c/strike\u003e one realized that, by adding a cheap frame interpolation chip, any source--including movies shot at 24 fps--could be nudged up to 60 Hz. (I say cheap because the same frame interpolation was already available as a transition on the first generation of DV camcorders back when I was in college.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere soap operas come in is their speed of production. To save time, they've always been shot with studio cameras, on video. Contrast this with bigger budget shows like \"Gilligan's Island\" or \"M*A*S*H\", which were shot on 16mm film and then transferred to video. It's entirely cultural. We've grown up with \"big budget\" material having that slower, more dreamlike motion of low frame rates, while soap operas have a sharper, jarringly more real motion. That's the \"soap opera effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why do soap operas have the soap opera effect?","tags":["effects","cinematography"],"score":5,"question_id":62298,"answer_id":62791}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":2701,"entidades":1.0}

Among those who espouse\n  film genre studies, epic is one of the most despised and ignored\n  genres\"[3] Finally, although the American Movie Channel formally\n  defines epic films as historical films, they nonetheless state the\n  epic film may be combined with the genre of science-fiction and cite\n  Star Wars as an example.[4]\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eStylistically, films classed as epic usually employ spectacular\n  settings and specially designed costumes, often accompanied by a\n  sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars. Epics\n  are usually among the most expensive of films to produce. They often\n  use on-location filming, authentic period costumes, and action scenes\n  on a massive scale. Biographical films may be less lavish versions of\n  this genre.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eMany writers may refer to any film that is \"long\" (over two hours) as\n  an epic, making the definition epic a matter of dispute, and raise\n  questions as to whether it is a \"genre\" at all. As Roger Ebert put it,\n  in his \"Great Movies\" article on Lawrence of Arabia:[5]\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe word epic in recent years has become synonymous with big budget B\n  picture. What you realize watching Lawrence of Arabia is that the word\n  epic refers not to the cost or the elaborate production, but to the\n  size of the ideas and vision.

This influences their status as \"bankable\" stars because having their name attached to the movie will draw people to watch the film that might have not watched it otherwise. This additional draw is the \"bankability\" of the star, and relies on people recognizing the name (weak) as well as whether they recall enjoying this actors films in the past (strong).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would also say that A-list status and bankability aren't always hand-in-hand even though they are very related. One handy heuristic I'd offer for bankability is if the movie is being described among your peers as \"the new \" then that actor is probably a bankable star for your peer. The fact that the movie is described as a certain actor's film means that actor is bankable in direct relation to the number of people talk favorably about it in those terms. For example Scarlett Johansson by box office take is \u003ca href=\"http://collider.com/scarlett-johansson-box-office/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ein the top 10 highest grossing stars\u003c/a\u003e by box office take. This clearly gives her A-list status (because many people know her name due to the success of her movies), but I don't know if I would consider her as bankable as Tom Cruise.

As it turns out I hated the movie, so now I'll be more careful about renting a movie based on her presence in the future. This is why actors need to balance accepting any role that comes their way to earn money and stay on the public's radar with avoiding movies that are likely to flop. To bring this back to my example Reese Witherspoon definitely earned money with her starring role in \u003cem\u003eHot Pursuit\u003c/em\u003e but her bankability suffered with me.

Formulaically, we describe null as \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e and the inverse of zero would be infinity: \u003ccode\u003e1/0\u003c/code\u003e. Since \u003ccode\u003ex/0\u003c/code\u003e has no algebraic solution, the \u003cem\u003eDe L'Hôpital\u003c/em\u003e approach would treat the denominator as the width of a differential. Dividing a differential of any size (\u003ccode\u003edx\u003c/code\u003e) by a null differential (\u003ccode\u003ed0\u003c/code\u003e) is essentially equivalent to driving the denominator towards nullity. You cannot really divide by nothing, but we can conceptually speak of what it means to divide by \"something\" that is approaching a dimensional-metric (a width) of \"nothingness\". All in all, this is the concept of a Singularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn our reality, we perceive of a 4-dimensional space-time. Our three spatial dimensions (height, width, and depth) vary along the unidirectional dimension of time; meaning that we only ever seem to go forwards in time. It's like time is a force, like gravity, and our universe is falling under its force, and we can't fight against it to go backwards. But if someone is pushing on you with a force, though you may not be strong enough to push back, that doesn't mean you can't \u003cem\u003ego around them\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf reality, beyond our perception, is hyperdimensional to our 4-D perceptions, then there exist fifth and sixth dimensions and beyond, such that if we could move along those dimensions we could go around time and essentially end up forwards or backwards in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this concept of dimensionality, a singularity -- an infinitude -- is a point of convergence, where all (or some) dimensionalities reach their limit. Dimensionality, for perceptual understanding and practical considerations, requires an origin, a limit, and a progression -- meaning that dimensionality must consist of a \"\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003emetric space\u003c/a\u003e\". As a measured dimensionality -- a metric space -- there is a nullity and an infinity. All points are measures from the nullity towards the infinity. If we picture our 3-D space as a sphere, the surface of that sphere is the infinity of our space, with the nullity (origin) at the center of the sphere. Infinity in this sense can be positive or negative, and has directionality in relation to the 3 components (call them \u003ccode\u003ex\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ey\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003ez\u003c/code\u003e) of our space. You can be at infinity in one, all three, or some combination of the dimensions, but you always end up on the sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other conceptual constructions of a multi-dimensional space, like a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eProjective Space\u003c/a\u003e (the spherical model is called Euclidean or Cartesian Space), there is only 1 infinity, a singular point of infinity, and the origin is actually a point, disc, sphere, or hypersphere. This is mostly conceptual, but there's a reality to it in the sense of modelling optics and light and abstract dimensional-scaling. In the Projective Space, the point at infinity is a singularity, as all infinities are, and it behaves like a \"black hole\". You can conceptually map points \u003cstrong\u003ethrough\u003c/strong\u003e the point at infinity, linking positive points to negative points, and the \"sign\" (negativity or positivity) of a point takes-on a meaning of directionality. By mapping \u003cstrong\u003ethrough\u003c/strong\u003e infinity, you create inversions, you \"flip\" every direction. So if a body, a collection of points, could pass through the singularity at the point of infinity, it would come out the \"other side\" inverted -- inside-out and upside-down, in every dimensionality of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we go back to Euclidean space, what happens when hit the surface of the sphere, but then keep travelling? Do you end up moving back towards the origin from where you hit -- did you bounce off the sphere? Or do you move towards the origin from the exact opposite side of the sphere? Which would be similar to Futurama episode (\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/19573468\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eS06E07\u003c/a\u003e, \"The Late Philip J. Fry\"), where they go so far forward in time that they \"come out the other side\" and \"catch up\" with where they left off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the concept of the \"black hole\" or the \"worm hole\". Singularities, points in dimensional space-time, that are connected to other points and allow for \"teleportation\". More conceptually, the singularity, leading back to the divide-by-zero issue, is a logical fallacy. How can you have a metric space, but be free to teleport from within the metric space? How does that not break all the concepts and reality of the measure(s) between discrete points in the space?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt does. But what if the space, the 4-dimensions, existed \u003cstrong\u003einside of\u003c/strong\u003e a higher dimensional reality?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow imagine that there is a 13-dimensional reality, and space-time is only 4 of those 13 dimensions. What appears like a singularity, a divide by zero, in our 4-dimensions (ex: \u003ccode\u003e[1, 1, 1, 1] / [0, 0, 0, 0]\u003c/code\u003e) is only such because it is null in our 4 dimensions but is non-null in other dimensions (ex: \u003ccode\u003e[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] / [0, 0, 0, 0, w]\u003c/code\u003e). We still have a divide-by-zero issue, but going back to (\u003cem\u003eDe L'Hôpital\u003c/em\u003e), that means that it's just beyond our language; we aren't really dividing by zero, we're \u003cstrong\u003eheading towards\u003c/strong\u003e an inverse nullity, which is really an infinity. But that means we're only heading towards infinity in our dimensions. In other dimensions we could be anywhere. So we might be at infinite time and infinite space points, but what if gravity has a dimensionality, a scale of its strength, we're at the \u003ccode\u003e+9.8\u003c/code\u003e point of gravity, so what if we \"circumvent\" time by going to the \u003ccode\u003e-10.2\u003c/code\u003e point of gravity then come back around to a \"previous\" point in time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo\u003c/strong\u003e, an \"Infinity Stone\", conceptually, seems to exist as a singularity point, a point at infinity, for its dimensionality. The \"Time Gem\", exists as the singularity for time, but allows free travel -- as the holder is so able to do -- in all other dimensions. Because you can travel freely -- in the limits of your abilities -- in all other dimensions, you can circumvent time. It's like time is a line drawn down the center of a room. If you travel along the line, you can't ever escape it, you're moving only forwards or backwards in time. But you're in a room, a room of many dimensions beyond this line. Imagine jumping over the line, running around the line, falling onto the line... you can go around it however you want, so long as you leave the line. But if you've left the line, where are you \"on\" the line? How did you \"get off of the line\"? Leaving the line, leaving \"time\", you've jumped out of the dimensionality, you've escaped into other dimensionalities, you've gone past the origin and the inverse origin, you've gone through the singularity. You are at \"infinity\" in time, meaning that you are anywhere except at a point in time; you're not at the beginning or the end, you're \u003cem\u003ebeyond\u003c/em\u003e. All things that are beyond time are immeasurable and innumerable by time, so they all \"exist\" at a singularity, at the infinity point \"in\" time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, Dormammu is in a \"Dark Dimension\" -- this is bad grammar and should be referred to as a \"Dark Space\" of at least 3-dimensions, because we see at least 3-dimensions during the movie; it's clearly not a single \"dimension\". The space of Dormammu, the dimensionality seems to have at least our similar 3 spatial dimensions, but as a space \"beyond time\", that is a grammatically tolerable way of saying that there is no \"time dimensionality\" to that space. If there's no \"time\", then things can move, but they aren't moving in time, they're moving either purely spatially, thus never changing/evolving temporally but rather  becoming new spatial points, being destroyed and recreated as something technically different with every \"motion\" -- which seems pretty \"dark\" and f***ked up, right? Or there are other dimensions, like gravity or electromagnetism or things we have no concepts for, or maybe even \"Love\" is a dimension; right, \"Interstellar\"?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it's a space without a time dimension, that's what it means to be \"beyond time\". The \"time gem\" is a singularity of time, an infinity, but that means that it exists in all other possible dimensions, so even if Dormammu's space has no time dimension, Dr. Strange can use the gem to travel \"around time\" in some other dimensions -- whichever ones he's comfortable traversing through -- and impose a \"time loop\" on the reality space that Dormammu exists within. Dormammu is stuck because the Time Gem is a worm-hole allowing Dr. Strange to travel through other dimensions, even \"beyond\" the point-in-time of his death. So when Dormammu kills him, he just returns to the \"checkpoint\" in time that he registered himself to with the \"spell\" cast using the Time Gem and the \"magical artifact\" it's held inside of. Now, this would mean that Dormammu could have saved itself by stealing the Time Gem from Dr. Strange and using it itself to go \"around\" the time loop; but clearly it didn't understand what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is the looming threat of collecting all the Infinity Gems into a Gauntlet of Power. If someone ends up with all the Infinity Gems -- Soul, Time, Space, Mind, Reality, and Power -- they have control of 6 singularities among the \u003ccode\u003eN\u003c/code\u003e total dimensions of all of reality. For each Gem, that means they can freely \"escape\" that dimension and traverse the others to manipulate \"reality\" in that Gem's dimensionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably why it's not a great idea to have a jerk like Dr. Strange walk around with it just hanging on his neck in a super obvious ornate piece of magical jewellery that all but screams \"steal me!\".\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How did the Time gem work in Dormammu\u0026#39;s dimension?","tags":["plot-explanation","marvel-cinematic-universe","doctor-strange"],"score":4,"question_id":62809,"answer_id":62817},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe answer here is the key revelation that Strange comes to in the climactic scene: he \u003cem\u003etakes time with him\u003c/em\u003e into Dormammu's domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand this, we have to backtrack to the Ancient One explaining to Strange how magic works. She explains that there are many other dimensions, each of which has their own set of rules. Many of these dimensions do not follow our natural laws -- Dormammu's domain, for example, has no concept of \"time\". What exactly this means isn't clear, but the implication is that Dormammu, and those things in his realm, do not \"age\" or \"evolve\" or even \"change\", as those are all concepts associated with time. His domain exists and grows by absorbing other dimensions, at which point those other dimensions become eternally part of Domammu's realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo cast spells, sorcerers draw energy from those other dimensions and pull it into our world, allowing them to \"break the rules\" using that extra-dimensional energy.

The Eye allowed him to, in essence, pull a \"bubble\" of time with in, that affected himself and the area around him.

More abstractly, he clearly has might but he disorganized his priorities. He didn't watch over his family, he violently \"defended\" his castle and his kingdom. This leaves him with the dramatic irony of having successfully defend a physical home that will now forever be an empty, family-less home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a nod to the concept that a house is not necessarily a home -- meaning that where you live is not always as important as how you live and who you live with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDracula was given power and he chose to use it for might, rather than to reflect on his circumstances, weigh his options, cherish his loved-ones, and make decisions that protect what he truly, really cares about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ending of the film suggests that perhaps he has a second chance, but has he truly learned from his past, or has he stewed in his rage and sorrow and not really taken ownership for his misprioritization and his own flaws and failures. Her death was not necessarily his fault, but wouldn't she still be alive if they had abandoned their castle, or given in to the other kingdom, or if he simply prioritized his family above his landscape and physical possessions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWas her death a logical incongruity? From certain viewpoints: sure. It seems that there's an incomparable set of limitations between his powers from scene to scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as a narrative element, as a rational and logical element of the consequences of his choices, and as circumstances in the limitations of the physical world there seems to be a very blunt and obvious difference between the lateral motions of his thudding destruction against the standing army, and the vertical motion of his attempt to overcome the physical limits of gravity and velocity to prevent a death of a loved one whom he left in a blindspot out of his own pride and rage and self-righteousness. Even with great power, there a limits and more importantly there are consequences. Her death is the result of circumstance and a causality that could have been prevented, but its saving was never truly prioritized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would say that it's not illogical. It seems like a circumstantial cost, and, like much of the film's narrative, it deepens the humanity of Dracula in the sense of focusing on exemplifying that choices have consequences, and there are no powers, otherwordly or otherwise, that can overcome consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e[Note, as an aside, we should also be careful in \"overpraising\" this narrative as aimed at Dracula's \"humanization\", as this is very much a one-dimensional objectification and sadistic moralization of the otherwise-should-have-been-inherent personhood of his wife, because it's not entirely humanizing to contextualize one person's emotional journey while treating all other persons as objects of choice in their path. She was her own person with her own dreams and powers and experiences and future, and that's always a sticking point in these kinds of narratives that keeps them from being truly elevated conceptually beyond their surface elements. I think there is a lot of deep meaning here, but it's also very very muddy to reflect solely upon Dracula's experience, while every other \"person\" in his life is treated barely better than emotionally-conducive furniture.]\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why can\u0026#39;t Dracula save Mirena from falling even with supernatural powers?","tags":["plot-explanation","dracula-untold"],"score":0,"question_id":62814,"answer_id":62816}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":2186,"entidades":1.0}

Even many dramatic films were short films in this era. Starting in about 1915-1916, there was a huge spurt in feature film production by the major studios like Paramount. There were many, many studios back then, because Wall Street had not gotten into the movie business yet, and the industry had not consolidated into a few major studios. I don't see nearly enough features from this period in this graph. (Film production plummeted in 1918 due to shortages in film stock, manpower and raw materials like lumber. Also the flu epidemic greatly depressed audience attendance.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eApproximately 80% of the movies from the 1920s, and 90% of the movies from the 1910s are lost. No known copies exist. There are a large number of early sound films from 1929-1931 that are also missing, because they were not deemed good enough for re-issues in theaters and/or TV, and the studios did not preserve a copy. While the most famous lost films like CLEOPATRA (1917) and LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT (1927) still have ratings on the IMDB, they are from users who have not seen the film.

During the 1910s, the average feature was 50-70 minues, about the length of a TV show episode today. By the 1920s, most features were over an hour, but many prestige features were longer than two hours. In the 1930s and 1940s, \"double feature\" programs are very popular in theaters, and the second feature was almost always about an hour again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeature film production contracted in 1930-1932 due to the Great Depression and several studios going bankrupt.

Several genres experienced \"booms\" that decade, often with the help of popular movies from the '70s - sci-fi series like \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn\u0026amp;q=star%20wars%20episode%20v\u0026amp;s=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eStar Wars\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn\u0026amp;q=mad%20max\u0026amp;s=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eMad Max\u003c/a\u003e began in the 1970s, and their sequels continued into the 1980s, often to wild success.

Its primary functions are to create anticipation of what’s to come (in The Mummy we see the execution of Imhotep, creating anticipation of his returning from the dead); curiosity about how these events will involve the hero (in The Exorcist we have no idea what unearthing an artifact in the desert has to do with a mother and daughter in Georgetown); exposition that will be needed to understand later events in the story (seeing the “human element” stop the launch of the missile in War Games explains why the computer system was created);  and/or a wound that will lead to the hero’s inner conflict later in the story (a young Jo watching her father swept away by a tornado in Twister).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA BOOKEND\u003c/strong\u003e is a sequence that takes place some time after the action of the rest of the screenplay, prior to going back in time and telling the story. A bookend carries a similar function to hearing the words, “Once upon a time…” and often includes a character who will narrate the rest of the film. This device is especially useful in biographies and period pieces, because it draws us into the screenplay before taking us back in time to a setting that might be hard for an audience to relate to. The Princess Bride, Out of Africa, The Road to Perdition and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button all employ bookend/narrator openings. Occasionally the “present-day” bookend opening continues its own story line, and the screenplay intercuts between the two, as in Titanic, Fried Green Tomatoes and The Usual Suspects (although The Usual Suspects adds the more complex combination of two flashbacks – we open at the end of the story that Verbal Kent will later tell from the beginning in the BOOKEND sequence, that takes place in the police station).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA MID-STORY PEAK MOMENT\u003c/strong\u003e is a sequence of high conflict from somewhere in the middle of the story. We then go back to the “beginning” of the story, which will unfold chronologically until we’re again watching the opening sequence, this time played out to completion. This peak moment elicits strong emotion because of the conflict, creates anticipation of what we know is to come, and creates curiosity about how we’re going to get there, and how the hero will ever be able to overcome that conflict. Iron Man opens this way, with Tony Stark left for dead after an attack in Afghanistan. Seven Pounds opens with Ben Thomas calling 911 to report his own suicide. And in Mission Impossible 3, Ethan Hunt is threatened with the death of his fiancée if he doesn’t reveal the information that his nemesis demands.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA NEMESIS INTRODUCTION\u003c/strong\u003e opens with the character who will become the greatest obstacle to the hero achieving his goal. This could be a villain (The Joker in The Dark Knight), an opponent (Apollo Creed in Rocky), a romantic rival (Cal in Titanic or Zachary in Wedding Crashers), or simply a character in opposition to the hero (Mozart in Amadeus or Raymond in Rain Man). By introducing the Nemesis before your hero, you open with immediate conflict, you create anticipation of the jeopardy that awaits the hero when she must face the far more powerful (or far more evil) Nemesis of the screenplay, and you create curiosity about what will bring them together, and how the hero will ultimately prevail. This is why we are introduced to the Joker in the opening sequence of The Dark Knight, and why we meet the cyborg from the future in The Terminator before we see Sarah Connor living her everyday life as a waitress.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\u003csup\u003e\u003csub\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/8xECrG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"THE PROLOGUE OPENING, Michael Hauge: Story Mastery\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"Is there a term for the prologue story present in the opening of a film?","tags":["terminology"],"score":5,"question_id":62882,"answer_id":62891}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":2117,"entidades":1.0}

They help each other first, but they are equal, which means, they can perform the trick again.\nWell, guess what: they do the trick and the \"husband\" disappears while the \"engineer\" appears somewhere else and people think he teleported. The husband must stay hidden to fool everyone, including his wife, and the engineer must take his place and goes home to fill in his space. The wife notices the wound is fresh, and possibly notices other \"things\" while her real husband is in the engineer disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make it short, they had to switch places because it would be difficult to keep the secret from the wife and still perform the trick in public (which includes the wife).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat is my point of view.

For another thing, if the projections were static or had a static symbol, an infiltrator could theoretically learn what that symbol is and mimic it after he gets inside your dream.

The best we can do is just count the number we specifically see on-screen, which is around a dozen or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it does look like both Strange and Dormammu \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e remember each loop. It's obvious that Dormammu remembers; the whole point is that, after enough repeats, Dormammu gets frustrated and makes a deal just to escape. If he didn't remember the previous iterations of the time loop, there's no reason for him to ever get frustrated. Also, note that Dormammu tries something to kill Strange different every time, implying that he knows his previous attempts didn't succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Strange, too, changes his behavior as his loop repeats. In his opening line to Dormammu, he starts to sound bored and frustrated, which only makes sense if he knows he's done this before. Also, IIRC, he seemed prepared for Dormammu's various attacks after they'd been used on him once, which only makes sense if he remembered them.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How many times did Dr. Strange loop?","tags":["marvel-cinematic-universe","doctor-strange"],"score":12,"question_id":63012,"answer_id":63017}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1987,"entidades":1.0}

Despite this, he feels as though he does not fit in with his\n  family or their high-society friends. When his sister's ex-boyfriend\n  Blanchard gives him a surreptitiously recorded tape of what sounds\n  like his family engaged in a vile, murderous orgy, Bill begins to\n  suspect that his feelings are justified.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eBill gives the tape to his therapist Dr. Cleveland to listen to.

Bill insists that\n  what he'd heard before was real and calls Blanchard to get another\n  copy.

Bill awakens in a hospital bed and thinks he\n  hears Blanchard crying out, but discovers that nothing is there. He\n  leaves the hospital and finds his Jeep waiting for him. Milo tries to\n  warn him, but he drives back to his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eBack home again, Bill finds a large, formal party.

The wealthy party guests strip to their\n  underwear and begin \"shunting\". The rich literally feed on the poor,\n  physically deforming and melding with each other as they suck the\n  nutrients out of Blanchard's body. Their intention is to do to the\n  same to Bill, but after escaping them and running about the house -\n  seeing his family melding with each other as well - Bill manages to\n  goad Ferguson into a fight. As the \"aliens\" cheer Ferguson on, Bill is\n  subdued, but in a surprise attack, Bill manages to reach inside the\n  pliable Ferguson and pull his head out through his buttocks, turning\n  him inside-out.

Universal Century makes up the dominating majority of the entire franchise. While many new Gundam stories are told in their own parallel universe with independent timelines, giving them a greater degree of creative freedom, the original U.C. storyline continues to be extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It established the series and delivered many of its best moments, as well as setting the standard for realistic hard science fiction in anime; the original Gundam marked the maturing of the Giant Robot genre. Also, nostalgia for the oldest of the Gundam shows (and Gundam's resulting status as a pop-culture icon in Japan) is still a major factor in its continuing success.\n  The creation of the separate timelines were originally stand-alone works that did not require prior knowledge of the Universal Century timeline to understand or appreciate the story's background. These timelines define Gundam differently and portray conflicts in entirely different settings and circumstances to other entries, including the definition of Gundam. For example, the original Gundam was considered a military general-purpose prototype mobile suit and a \"Gundam\" from G Gundam is considered a name for a mobile fighter whose purpose is to compete against other Gundams\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"Early to mid 2000s Mech anime/show?","tags":["identify-this-tv-show"],"score":1,"question_id":63100,"answer_id":63112}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1899,"entidades":1.0}

A comic relief character often needs to look funny or fits a mock-able stereotype.  It's much easier for a male actor who looks goofy to have an extended career than a female one, so there is a larger pool of readily available talent for those kinds of roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor studios, themselves, are more interested in making money than the pure artistry, in general, so they like to keep recycling things that have made money for them.  Goofy male sidekick tends to go over well? They're going to greenlight projects with that, just like they like to do \"reboots\" of popular stories and sequels, or movies that fit a particular formula.  If they are nervous about general box-office appeal, they might even push for the addition of that element into a movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of time the comedy of the comic relief character is, to a large degree, laughing AT that character.  It's a bit safer and more comfortable, agree with it or not, to laugh at a male character without running into accusations of sexism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, while less common, those kids of roles do exist.  You see them all the time in movies that are more dominated by female characters because their companions who they interact with are going to be more heavily female-populated.  Even in more traditionally male-led casts, you will see some good ones.  Here's a few I can think of - \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJoan Cusak's role as John Cusak's office manager for his assassination business in Grosse Pointe Blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer Lawrence's ditsy, money-grubbing bored housewife role in American Hustle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa Tomei as Mona Lisa Vito, the girlfriend of Joe Pesci's character in My Cousin Vinny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhoopi Goldberg as the psychic in Ghost\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe title-specific role of Owen's mother in the movie Throw Mamma From the Train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI'm sure there are many others that people can think of.

Arriving at the\n  remote mining town, Ballard finds all of the people missing. She\n  learns that they had discovered an underground doorway created by an\n  ancient Martian civilization.

It also proposes a mystery, of which more is uncovered as the story develops. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's only a moment, but to my memory there is a large, dark house, being approached by several official-looking men (MACUSA I imagine), and a white-haired man defeating them all quickly and effortlessly. In movie-language, this effectively presents us with our main villain, dispelling any curiosities from the very beginning that there may be some involvement by Voldemort, Tom Riddle, or other familiar character from the Potterverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs this film was always intended to be the first of a series of films, there are several unanswered questions. One being the imagery of this introductory scene (which in its nature almost feels like a flashback, or in the HP-world, possibly a vision or premonition), but also the Lestrange lineage mentioned briefly. There is plenty to uncover throughout this series of films presented initially within this movie, and I believe most characters met in this film will feature again in future to explore their stories and character arcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI firmly believe that this introductory scene will best be played out as a slow-burn mystery, only revealing the meaning of the scene in the last film of the franchise. The Harry Potter films have found huge viral success and has sustauined its longevity by having so many small, tiny, seemingly insignificant details uncovered for years after its release. To embark on a new movie franchise, appealing to the same fans, and set in the same universe, without featuring hugely overarcing mysteries and secrets, would be a huge waste of a long-set up ideology.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What does the first scene in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them mean?","tags":["plot-explanation","fantastic-beasts"],"score":0,"question_id":63724,"answer_id":63725}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1275,"entidades":1.0}

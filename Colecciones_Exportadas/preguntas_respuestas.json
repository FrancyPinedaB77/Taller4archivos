She was attracted to his charming nature and she could not resist herself from thinking of Walter.

He was waiting for the dialogue card to roll in when the policeman started talking to him, as was the premise of the movie. When this didn't happen he was confused, it felt as if he was ostracised not only from the hollywoodland world, but from this same \"The Artist\" picture altogether. Thus he decided it was time to call it quits. It's a meta-thing. To me, the \"accent\" explanation is contrived and the repeat of the \"disorienting live sound\" explanation doesn't make sense as a vehicle at that point, it's regressive. So the key to interpret the scene is the absence of dialogue-cue cards. Notice how he takes his eyes away from the policeman and where the director or crew of the film is supposed to be, almost desperately waiting and ponderding as to why they are taunting him with not doing their job and not providing cards. He's like \"oh, now you wanna make THIS movie a talking one, screw you then, I'm out of here\". The resolution of the film then comes, not only in terms of the story, but very much so from this movie remaining a silent one after the averted suicide (notice the BANG card, there weren't any \"sound-descriptive cards\" up to then, also the making-up scene is eeriely silent despite the windy conditions, barking, shouting, crying, laughing, etc.). Then comes the accent thing, as a twister on that. But only as a twister. If the accent thing was all that important, the big producers would never ask of George to transition in the first place.

As pointed out in analysis found elsewhere (and even Lars himself may have suggested this), her name is possibly a reference to Novel of same name by Marquis de Sade in which Justine is struck down by a bolt from God. Recall the scenes with lightening emanating from Justine's fingers. While he may have taken her name from this character and found inspiration there, I do think that Justine is also patterned after Eve from Genesis. Her clairvoyance - she describes to Claire as always knowing things - possibly a reference to her having eaten from the Tree of Knowledge leading to banishment from Eden. Her confusion during the reception - repeatedly seeking guidance from Mom \u0026amp; Dad. Her apparent estrangement with her husband (how would it be to one day wake up and realize - you've been created to be someone's bride?) I think as the mother of mankind, she may also be seen here to be representative of mankind, and of course she also represents the planet Melancholia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eMichael (Justine's husband) is a name that comes from the Hebrew meaning \"who is like God\". I believe Michael is patterned after Adam from Genesis. The obvious symbolism supporting this is the photo of the Apple orchard he gives to Justine at the reception which, of course is not well received. Also, he's portrayed as a simple man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGaby (Justine \u0026amp; Claire's mother) is the Archangel (Gabriel) or God's messenger or possibly God herself (as depicted in feminine). Her demeanor and dialog could come right from Old Testament fire and brimstone - \"enjoy it while it lasts\" and telling Justine when her counsel is sought to grow up and that she should be afraid. Also her shirt shows a spiral with an arrow pointing inward - not sure if there is a traditional meaning to this symbol but it could be describing the path of planet Melancholia on its approach to earth. Realistically, this path is the only way that a planet could remain hidden, as described, behind the sun; if it were synchronized on an orbital plane with and 180 degrees opposite that of earth and spiraling towards us. There is also a shot of Gaby the morning after the reception basking in the morning light and posing prayer-like. Oh yeah, and her husband - brace yourselves …\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDexter (Justine \u0026amp; Claire's father) from the Latin meaning on the right side - yup, Jesus Christ. Not a very flattering portrayal. As people have pointed out - Lars does enjoy poking sticks now and then. Other than the name and relationship to Gaby, we have the two Betty's. It's my understanding that Lars converted to Catholicism for a time as an adult. Here's a question for you all: for people who are not raised Christian, what would you say are the biggest obstacles to their acceptance of the religion? In other words, if you had to make a list of the things Christians accept on faith, what two would be at the top of the list? Mine would be resurrection and virgin birth - Betty 1 and Betty 2? The scene with Little Father where Dexter removes the spoons may be a reference to miracles. All the guests see the deception but Little Father continues to serve obediently without questioning …\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eLittle Father of course there's the name, and the two key scenes - as mentioned the spoons and then later when he returns Gaby's belongings to the estate after John tosses them out the door.

John is introduced to us as the smart one. He confidently identifies Melancholia to Justine as (I think it was) Antares. Point is, he was wrong. He again points out to Justine that the golf course has 18 holes and we later see a 19th green - wrong again! He also asserts that Melancholia will just fly right by - three strikes and you're out! John is another composite - possibly representing modern man who has replaced belief in God with science. The dialog of John is telling and this character is (IMO) some of Lars' best work here. John repeatedly uses the term \"unbelievable\" when referring to Gaby. He also tries to eject Gaby from the proceedings as he's apparently attempted to do on other occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eJack from the Hebrew equivalent Yaakov meaning he who supplants.

Bridge represents passage from Eden into man's world (Sodom and Gomorrah?) Explains Abraham's behavior. Additional scenes to support Holy Land theory - quick scene during prologue showing burning bush on estate grounds; the scene with limousine may be a reference to Matthew 7:14 which translates to roughly \"\u003cem\u003ebut the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGolf course - probably some of the most beautiful places on earth that are the work of man are found on golf courses.

Justine is seen urinating on golf course and later commits adultery with Tim in of all places a sand hazard - possibly an injection of humor from LVT?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're interested in an interpretation of Claire's story that follows from his, I'll add more later if asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEdit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot to address your question about the golf cart dying before the bridge.

Such rigors of re-learning were probably constant throughout his life.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eStanislavski's system is a method for actors to produce realistic characters on stage.

In this technique, the actor would perform a physical motion or a series of physical activities to create the desired emotional response for the character. Emotions were considered to be formed from the subconscious, so this technique allowed the actors to consciously target and control their subconscious emotions through movement. For instance, if an actor needed to weep, he could sigh and hold his head in his hands, a physical action that many who are crying instinctively do...\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe correct physical action does not come automatically for every psychological response nor are they stimulate identical responses for every individual.

Industrial clients examining buildings for structural flaws needed to see Paris from above. Parisian airspace, however, is tightly controlled; nonmilitary aircraft may fly over the city only on Bastille Day. Lamorlette found that by morphing between two photographs, he could generate a 3-D model: digital photogrammetry. BUF employed the technique to help director Michel Gondry create a music video for the Rolling Stones. Its radical camera moves - zipping through a room full of partygoers frozen in midmotion - caused a sensation in Europe. (BUF also used this method to make a Gap ad called \"Khakis Swing\" that was most Americans' first glimpse of the effect.)\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eGaeta and Kim Libreri pumped up this technique for \u003cem\u003eThe Matrix\u003c/em\u003e: By triggering a circular array of 122 still cameras in sequence, they were able to simulate the action of a variable-speed movie camera that tracked completely around its subject.

The film - a flyover of the UC Berkeley campus - was generated entirely from still photographs. Like the 19th-century cartographers, Debevec and his team derived the precise shapes and contours of the landscape by triangulating the visual information in still photographs. Then they generated 3-D models based on this geometry, but instead of applying computer-generated textures to the models, they wrapped them with photographs of the buildings themselves. The trick worked spectacularly well.

The mind tends to believe what it thinks it sees and thinks it feels. Fischer starts to die. Once he dies he will wash up on the shores of Limbo. But that hasn't happened yet. Cobb and Ariadne think there is still one shot to get Fischer back. The way to do it by going down in to Cobb's mind at this point because, after all, Fischer is dying because of Cobb's mind. Fischer's dying mind can be reached using Cobb's mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey hook up the dying body of Fischer and Ariadne to Cobb's mind and go one level further down. Now, they do reach limbo, but this is because only 3 levels of dreams were architected. Neither did Cobb nor Ariadne die and reach Limbo. This is why they know where they are and what they are here to do. Also because they are in Cobb's mind, they know where they need to go because Cobb knows where Mal will be.

In this case, his mind heads towards his dying father and focuses on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSaito, on the other hand, is shot by Fischer's militarized mind. Even if they went down into Fischer's mind, they would have no idea where to look for Saito because Saito was shot to protect his mind from getting attacked, Fischer has no obsession with anyone particular from his past. Besides, Fischer is being kidnapped, they would have to convince him to be the dreamer.  Going down into Fischer's mind would also ruin the plan as they need to take Fischer through other dreamers deeper and deeper till the 3rd level and incept on his unsuspecting mind. The only thing they can do is hope to complete inception before Saito dies by descending further as the time dilation will give Saito more time to live. However, thanks to Mal being projected, they loose more time and Saito eventually dies and lands up on the shores of Limbo.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How did they bring Fischer back to life within the 3rd layer of the dream?","tags":["plot-explanation","inception"],"score":1,"question_id":1152,"answer_id":31464},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eFischer is shot in the 3rd layer of the dream and enters the limbo. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn limbo, you are actually in your own mind, you don't follow the rules of others.

If the change you made in time affects the future you have to wait for it to catch up to you. An example of this is when Marty saves his dad he alters history but it takes about a week to catch up to his present and erase him from time. Even if he had jumped in the time machine and traveled back to 1985 Hill Valley he would have had to wait a week. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you travel back into time from an altered future point (from 2015 to Biff altered 1985) the transition is instantaneous.

My belief is that the Flux Capacitor creates a temporary bubble around time travelers that allow them to be absorbed into a changed time line rather than sudden disruption. So Old Biff would not have been able to travel to future Biff ruled 1985 or even 2015 because he is such a completely different individual in those times as well as the world around him has changed so drastically. Marty was able to travel to an alternative 1985 instantly in the first Back to the Future because it was so close to his current 1985. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words there is one time stream in Back to the Future. It can branch and make new futures but those are eventually absorbed into the one time stream. The further it branches off from the original time stream the longer it takes for changes to catch up to current time.

The writer intentionally left the movie ambiguous in the first place, so there is no ending set in stone, but I've always thought that, although they rekindle their relationship, they do eventually break up because of their flaws. I don't actually agree with whole \"they go back to Lacuna\" part, because Mary's discovery and leaving with the documents implies that Lacuna will be hurt by all of their patients' discoveries, which may evoke a decidedly negative reaction as with her. (Of course, I could be wrong, but that's just my view.) The looping scene, in my opinion, symbolizes that they will break up, but also that they will get back together. I've always related this to those on-and-off couples. Maybe somewhere down the line, their flaws will becomes less magnified and a more concrete relationship will abound. Or maybe they are doomed to keep going back to each other, possibly out of true love. They are humans, and being humans, they are prone to repeating something that initially gave them pleasure, regardless of the negative note it will end on. While Joel has the memory erasing process done, he realizes that the good times he had with Clem outdid their breakup; \"It's better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.\" And who's to say that some time couldn't have occupied the gaps between the loops? Maybe they saw different people to help gain new experiences, and were repeatedly drawn to each other afterwards. They didn't seem that old in the movie, so maybe somewhere down the line, when they've completely matured, they might decide to settle down. Orrrr, maybe it symbolizes that memory lives on, longer than the physical experience, and that candid scene was just an enduring addition to his experiences as they moved on from each other. There's so many different ways one can interpret the ending. :D\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What goes down in final scene of \u0026quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u0026quot;?","tags":["plot-explanation","ending","eternal-sunshine"],"score":3,"question_id":1194,"answer_id":18947},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe \"Okay\" is Joel saying, \"I don't care if it falls apart again.

Rather, I think the wrong question was asked. The final scene of the movie isn't in the hallway, it's of the two of them running on the snowy beach. If you remember, it jump cuts and replays, signifying them re-creating the memory, obviously. But then it does it AGAIN, right before the credits roll. The obvious answer to me is that their is another erasure to follow the relationship begun in the hall, or, that we actually watched the 2nd go around, their true first meeting never being shown. (We do never see Naomi, and Joel mentions something is odd about their relationship in the beach house) However, I think the 1st explanation is more feasible; that they are two weak souls, dying to be together, but incapable of not screwing things up. Had it not been for that second jump cut, I would be 100% in Max's corner. But to anyone that didn't think about that, I urge you to watch it again. It seriously gave me chills.

It all has to do with the fact, that they both hear the tapes that were recorded of themselves when going to get the initial treatment done. When Clementine comes to Joels apartment at the very end, listening to the tapes he comes to a realization. That in retrospect, the relationship he had with Clem was really one of the most important things in his life, and despite the fact that he saw flaws in her, he is willing to overlook them indefinatley to make a happy life with Clem. The fact that you can listen to a tape of a person listing the other persons absolute worst flaws and still want to be in a relationship says it all to me. The ending of the film really comes together for me in a particulary beautiful and touching scene during Joel's \"treatment\" dream, when he is reliving the 2nd time he saw Clementine at Barnes and Noble after he met her at the beach party. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be different....

Stevie also seems to be associated with another Dostoevsky heroine in Sonya from Crime and Punishment. Sonya prostitutes herself for the sake of her family and falls for murderous Raskolnikov, the alienated protagonist of Crime and Punishment. [...] Stevie’s extended kindness is revealed to be the true saviour of Reznik as one of his final conversations with her reveals he has finally transgressed from killer to victim and he now understands his crime and acknowledges his guilt and moral responsibility...\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe devil incarnate Rogozhin, can be link to the hellish figure of Ivan, a deformed character [...] whose confidence and personality are equally repulsive and inciting.

Ivan is seemingly Reznik’s opposite and yet the two are cut from the same cloth as their identities overlap. [...] Ivan is Trevor Reznik’s conscience but he is also a strand of his former personality [...] It is the fictional Ivan who forces Reznik to confront his sins, till the very end and perhaps Reznik’s views his machinist self through the transgressed identity of the grotesque Ivan...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI personally have only read Crime and Punishment and always thought that there was a direct link between this and the Machinist due to the main character in each ultimately being driven mad by the guilt from the act they committed and ultimately handing themselves in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReading the first article above would suggest there is a rather large link with The Idiot as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Is there real connection between The Machinist and Dostoyevsky\u0026#39;s books?","tags":["analysis","reference","the-machinist"],"score":10,"question_id":1257,"answer_id":2421}],"quota_max":300,"quota_remaining":69}

In looking over Frederika's bedroom, Clarice notices the the triangular gussets on Frederika's dresses match the pieces of skin Bill cut from one of his victims. Clarice calls Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to inform him that Bill is making a \"woman suit\" of real skin. Crawford is already in route to Chicago, having identified Bill as Jame Gumb, but they find that the house where he's supposedly living has been abandoned. Clarice continues to poke around in Belvedere and is eventually led to the house of \"old Mrs Littman.\" Mrs Littman doesn't live there any more, but the current resident, who calls himself Jack Gordon, offers to give her Mrs Littman's son's business card and invites Clarice inside to wait. When she notices spools of thread and a Death's-Head moth, she realizes that Jack Gordon is really Jame \"Buffalo Bill\" Gumb. She pulls her gun on him, but Gumb leads her on a wild goose chase into the basement, where he has Catherine Martin imprisoned in a well. Gumb dons a night vision mask and turns out the lights, leaving Clarice to feel around in the dark. When he makes the mistake of cocking his gun, Clarice shoots him. Catherine is subsequently rescued. In the final scenes, Clarice is shown graduating from the Academy. At the party that follows, she receives a phone call from Lecter, calling from the airport on the island of Bimini in the Bahamas. He assures her that he's not about to come looking for her and requests that she extend him the same courtesy, which Clarice cannot do, of course.

In the original theatrical version there is only a single shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBear in mind that they are sitting down, at a table in the Cantina bar, opposite each other. Greedo goes for his gun, saying, \"I'm going to enjoy this\".

Greedo slumps face-down on the table, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don't understand where the suggestion has come from that Solo shot him in cold blood.

The crash is a visible and audible symbol of change coming. In the immediate conversation that follows, Kane introduces Bernstein as his general manager and announces that the paper is now a 24-hour enterprise. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don't think the spill is an indictment of Bernstein's competence, though, as moments later we discover Bernstein has already ordered 6 phones for the office and instructs Carter to get a discount, after which \"Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI've looked at three different versions of the script, and only one included Bernstein's \"Oops!\" - this may have been an adlib that is recorded in later versions but not originally intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"In \u0026quot;Citizen Kane\u0026quot; does Bernstein purposely take a tumble into the newspaper office?","tags":["plot-explanation","citizen-kane"],"score":4,"question_id":1360,"answer_id":3665},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eI can't think of any reason why, or even how, Kane and Bernstein would use an intentional fall as a way of helping to seize control of the newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're looking for some meaning of that moment, to me it accentuates the relationship between the three characters of Kane, Leland, and Bernstein. When the trio arrive at the newspaper, Kane and Leland are riding in the front of the stagecoach-thing (?) while Bernstein is on the carriage behind them, sitting on top of the furniture that he later trips up with.

Jed Leland is a strong character and one of a few who can stand up to Kane as the latter loses his way. On the other side of the coin, Bernstein is like a lap dog to Kane. Unwaveringly loyal but also always in his shadow.

He is also an avid hoarder; the amount of belongings he brings in and the way he uses them to assert himself in the newspaper is emphasised comically in these scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"In \u0026quot;Citizen Kane\u0026quot; does Bernstein purposely take a tumble into the newspaper office?","tags":["plot-explanation","citizen-kane"],"score":7,"question_id":1360,"answer_id":1728}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9964}

We are told that Mal invented the totem concept.  It could be the case that at the time Cobb and Mal are in Limbo that only she has a totem and that he has not yet adopted that idea.

He seems strongly to believe that they are awake at the time she takes her own life, which appears to support the idea that he has a totem of his own at this point.  His thinking might be that since he knows he is awake, he would then be able to adopt and use Mal's totem safely from then on.  This is the only answer I have to your question - he took and used the totem when he could validate that he was already in the real-world, and trusted that he could then use the new totem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever this is one of many points in the movie that are (I believe) intended to make us wonder whether he is still in a dream in the 'real world' at the start and end of the movie.  The argument that he could use his own totem to validate his awake state before taking and using Mal's totem seems fairly watertight, particularly as it has an easy to interpret sign (if it does not stop spinning he must be in a dream).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever conversely this easy to interpret signal is also a weak point in using the totem that she designed.  Everyone else's totem has something about it that only they understand - Arthur's loaded dice, Ariadne's weighted chess piece.  One can imagine that anyone could dream the spinning top falling over, perhaps Mal had a more detailed and subtle understanding of the top that would enable her to distinguish it falling over in someone else's dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am therefore guessing that at the time he took the top, he was in the real-world as he was using his own totem at the time.

Maybe he didn't care for Kananga and wanted him gone. Notice how he just walked into the room, before Kanaga smashed Solitare in the face, Kanaga had no power over him. Solitare was scared crapless by him as much as Kanaga. He was just the soul of the island so to speak. Once Bond came in and destroyed everything he had no power or purpose anymore there and was stuck with Bond. Either that or he is stuck on that train for eternity laughing his butt off.

You could also say Solitare's power is in thanks to his presence, he could have been there for ages when her mom was alive, who knows? Once Bond is there he feels his presence due to all of the violence and death he's caused and he feels a respect hence the duel later on.

Early in the film he is playing a person playing Samedi for the tourists and Kananga.

I take it that this real person is killed in the coffin of snakes but, of course, Samedi himself cannot die as he is an immortal so appears again at the end of the film.  I guess it is allegorical.  At this point Holder is playing Samedi himself not the man Bond killed.  No one knows for sure that's part of the fun but we can read something into Fleming's title Live and Let Die.  It is of course a play on Live and Let Live but it also has a secondary meaning here as Samedi's role in vodou is as Loa of Ressurection.  It is he who decides who lives and dies and only the Baron can decide who moves from the world of the living into the world of the dead.  Unlike the grim reaper who is ...well grim ...

Furthermore you have the entire crew (who would need to be very quiet) waiting around while the sound guys do their work.

It is a deliberate anachronism on the part of the creator with a twofold intent. Milch has explained in several interviews that the characters were originally intended to use period slang and swear words. Such words, however, were based heavily on the era's deep religious roots and tended to be more blasphemous than scatological. Instead of being shockingly crude (in keeping with the tone of a frontier mining camp), the results sounded downright comical.

In fact, in early episodes, the character of Mr. Wu seems to know only three words of English — the mangled name of one character (\"Swedgin\"), \"San Francisco\", and his favorite derogatory term for those whom he dislikes, \"cocksucka\". Wu is fond of the Cantonese derogatory term \"gweilo\" which he applies to the camp's white males.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe other intent in regards to the frequency of the swearing was to signal to the audience the lawlessness of the camp in much the same way that the original inhabitants used it to show that they were living outside the bounds of \"civil society\".\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe issue of the authenticity of \u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e's dialogue has even been alluded to in the show itself.

She remembers Irene Demova. She remembers them carving their names into the frame of their dream house. And as Chuck tells her the story of their great romance, you can see her slowly beginning to connect with the rest. If she's not all the way back now, she will be eventually. He's her Chuck, she's his Sarah, and they get to fall in love all over again, and that's pretty damn sweet.

They also vary from show to show, so for any one \"rule of thumb\" it's almost guaranteed you can find an exception on the air right now on some channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic guidelines that most shows follow most of the time are drawn from the rules for the various industry guilds. In the case of actors, that would be SAG (the WGA and DGA would determine how/when a writer or director get credited.) The Wikipedia articles linked in a few comments/answers gives a basic rundown of all the guild rules that have to be followed in the \"typical\" credits sequence. Note that movies opening and closing credit sequences differ a lot from television ones (in particular, you rarely see the name of the production company in a TV show's opening credits.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there's a lot of variation on the basic theme, because the placement and styling in the credits sequence is often part of an actor's individual contract with the studio. Studios will rearrange the credits or give certain actors special consideration in the credits as part of the negotiations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic flow of credits is as you mentioned: core actors first, followed by guest actors, followed by a handful of top-level production staff. In TV, it's rare to have a full set of closing credits the way you have in movies, where the entire cast would appear with their character names, for simple time reasons: they would take a really long time that could instead be used for commercials. (In fact, many networks now show split-screen closing credits side by side with a promo for the upcoming program.) So those credits are usually limited to production-level people and companies, copyright/legal notices, and other minutia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e a particular actor gets a particular spot in the credits is mostly a matter of PR, and explains some of the variations you mention in your question:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBeing billed before the title is \"more prestigious\" than after the title; usually only the one or two top-tier stars will get this billing, if at all. In ensemble shows it's rare to see this type of split billing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActors are generally billed in rough \"order of importance\" to the show.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBeing billed \u003cem\u003elast\u003c/em\u003e, however, is also considered a key position, as long as it is somehow differentiated from the rest of the cast. For example, in the \u003cem\u003eBuffy\u003c/em\u003e TV show, Anthony Stewart Head (arguably the most \"famous\" cast member prior to the show) was billed as \"and Anthony Stewart Head as Giles\" - the only cast member whose character was named.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSince the opening credits are pre-recorded, typically only season regulars make it into the \"core\" credits sequence (think \"theme music\") for shows that have them. Recurring guest stars are usually billed overtop of the opening scene, introduced with \"Also Starring\".\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSingle-episode guest stars go last; depending on how famous/important they are, they may also get the \"as \u003cem\u003echaractername\u003c/em\u003e\" treatment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, having a unique style of credit (e.g. being specifically associated with a character) is a bonus given out to special guest stars and particularly important actors that lets them stand out from the rest of the cast. This is something a well-known or highly-priced actor would negotiate as a condition of their appearance. They even negotiate down to the exact wording, which can include \"guest\" vs. \"special guest\", are they \"starring\" or \"appearing\", etc (I have seen shows that had multiple guest stars, each billed slightly differently).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother key distinction to make is between series regulars and recurring guest stars. A series regular will still appear in the opening credits, and be given credit for the episode, even if they don't actually appear in the episode. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe general idea here is that a series regular, even if they aren't in a particular episode, is contractually required to \u003cem\u003ebe available to appear\u003c/em\u003e in that episode. A recurring guest actor, on the other hand, is typically contracted to appear in only a specific number of episodes, and can usually skip a particular episode if they have prior commitments. A recurring guest star, with lower billing, may actually get more screen time than a series regular that gets top billing. This happened in \u003cem\u003eHouse\u003c/em\u003e in seasons 4-6, where Olivia Wilde, Kal Penn and Peter Jacobson were given lower \"Also Starring\" billing, while rarely-appearing Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer continued to be billed as series regulars. As always, this was entirely down to the contracts the latter two had with the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What rules govern how TV show opening credits are structured?","tags":["casting","credits"],"score":20,"question_id":1468,"answer_id":3150},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eOn a side note, the convention for animated shows is to only include the Show Title, Creator, and Developers.

Each of the three central characters have experienced some sort of trauma or loss\nin their past. Preest/David lost his younger sister as well as having experienced the trauma of war as a soldier; Milo had lost his father as a child and then, more\nrecently, had his fiancee leave him very close to the day of their planned wedding. Amelia had probably, though it wasn't explicitly said, been abused by her father as\na child and her and her mother had left him as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDavid/Preest's father was a man of religion and had said that the death of his daughter - David/Preest's sister was the will of god. Preest was unable to accept this\nand he blamed his father for the death of his sister. This, along with the trauma of war, had triggered a psychotic episode in him. He wanted to avenge the death of \nhis sister and because he saw the death of his sister as so unjust, he took issue with religion as a whole. The line in the film \"if god is willing to stop bad things\nhappening but unable, then he is not omnipotent, if he is able but unwilling then he is malevolent, if he is neither willing or able then he is not a god\" explains\nPreest's inner torment perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMilo has recently been through a break-up just before he was due to get married. He then starts to see a childhood friend/love interest, Sally. She is not real. He\nfirst saw Sally just after his dad died - a very traumatic experience - and began to see her again after the break-up of his relationship with his fiancee - another\ntraumatic experience. He tells his friend the story of the story-teller who's stories became reality. At the end of the film when he meets Amelia, who looks exactly\nlike his imaginary friend, Sally, it begs questions of fate. It also means that the story-teller is in fact Milo - What he believed became reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia is slightly less significant in the film but she needs to be there for Milo's story to make sense.

This is a technique used most famously by\n  John Williams in the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e saga, whereby each character has\n  their own theme which reoccurs throughout the films, albeit in\n  different styles, reflecting the characters' current state of\n  mind/situation/interaction with others. Look at Vader's theme. Heavy\n  brass through the original trilogy, and then played on a harp as he\n  dies - beautiful and deeply moving. For my film, I have a main\n  character who is the antagonist (villain) of the piece, and is at odds\n  with the other characters. For this reason, I had his theme not only\n  jar against the rest of the soundtrack, but it becomes strained and\n  unravels as he becomes more dangerous during the film's progression.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eI also asked my composer to create a theme for the landscape (there is\n  mountain climbing involved), and we used this opportunity to include\n  ethnic instruments that reinforce the geography and the nationality of\n  the protagonists.

The most likely is that Simon shot himself accidentally. Earlier in the film the gun malfunctioned and it's possible that it accidentally fired again as he tried to give it to his partner. Another possibility is that the stupid partner of Simon shot him, since he would have been able to see he was about to kill Jessica (and was perhaps confused by the situation)? Quite a waffly answer I know, but I think the prevailing opinion is that it happened due to the faulty gun.

It certainly looks like Jynx and Nick are on the phone to each other. Possibly what we hear is their conversation from earlier and we are watching the \"afterwards\" and they are talking to other people. But this seems unlikely. I think they are talking to each other, although I can't back that up with anything other than by saying it seems logical.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eI assume he's on the phone to Nick who is coming out of the bank.

Something of a non-local seismic disturbance. The decision to not only involve him in a new job in London, but to send Don, Satan's hunting dog, to make sure Gil complies.

This assumption is based off Don's character, particularly how he reacts to his cohorts' intimacy and sexual activity throughout the movie that's shown, implied and symbolized as well as through the character's own testimony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon Logan is an individual who is sexually repressed to the point intimacy infuriates him. We first see Don Logan alone in his underwear, listening to his superior describe an incident where their boss was sodomized. Don Logan rather than being disgusted asks questions till he knows every detail of Bass's motivation as well as the plans for the heist. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis scene revealed Don as desperate for human-contact, even perhaps physical affection. This is reaffirmed when Don takes each of Gal's rejections to participate in the heist extremely personally . . . to the point he physically harms Gal, almost like a jealous lover. This clearly represents the actions of a psychopath, and there are a lot of scenes that show that aspect of Don Logan. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe're shown Don Logan is incapable of connecting to others when he chooses to talk to himself rather than other people, just right before he attacks Gal. We're shown Don Logan has the ability to mimic what's considered 'normal' behavior - like a real psychopath - when he repeats the conversations he's had with his superiors . . . almost verbatim. We're even shown his lack of empathy for Gal, Aitch and Gal's pool boy when he severely injures all three. Now the thing to keep in mind is, yes Don Logan is an irredeemable psychopath - but there's something at the heart of Don Logan's neurosis driving him - so keep that in mind. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow if we're to examine Gal's 1st dream sequence, it's actually showing the\n'potential' for harm Gal will encounter due to Don Logan's far-reaching sexual hostility\n- no matter what Gal chooses to do. In essence, because Don Logan's repression is what makes him so dangerous Gal can't do anything; have you ever tried talking to someone who's going through a dry spell - it is the pinnacle of awkward and the way the cast acts around Don Logan is overtly-cautious and sheepishly, taking great effort not to offend. And like us, the audience, Gal is forced to sit across from the automatic pistol carrying Rabbit, remaining dumbfound at his table - a kind of elephant in the room if you will. The Rabbit doesn't fire . . . just points the gun threateningly at Gal. We see this kind of heightened sexual resentment in Don all throughout the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon Logan does what he can to get to Gal due to this resentment: he reminds Gal DeDe was a hardcore pornstar who had sex with hundreds, threatens to tell Aitch that he slept with Jackie - which may not even be true due to Don Logan's propensity to lie - Don even claims he loves Jackie 3 years after assumedly one night with her, which Jackie neither confirms or denies. These all serve as justification for Don Logan not just to be alone but also undesirable to the opposite sex and even the same sex. Even Bass (a bisexual) doesn't seem to be phased by his loyal henchman's disappearance as he claims \"if I gave a solitary fuck about Don . . . \" which serves two purposes: (1) implying a more than personal history where even he couldn't stand Don Logan, seeing him as a means to an end, and (2) dehumanizing Don Logan to the point he's less than man which is shown time and again, best evident by the same actor portraying the anthropomorphic rabbit. But this is not the best evidence to support this argument; the BEST evidence to drive this point home comes in the form of the visual symbolism of Sexy Beast. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, in the 1st act a giant boulder has destroyed the Dove's pool, it's drained to be fixed at the same time Don Logan visits. It comes as no surprise during the interim of Don Logan's stay the chemistry between the Dove's suffers, but it's more what's implied about the situation that ends up revealing more about Don Logan's character. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe significance of the pool is important because not only has the director included numerous scenes of characters interacting with it, but FREQUENTLY in cinema water is used psychologically as a visual metaphor for sex - and in this movie it's used heavily . . . except in scenes with Don Logan. Now isn't it odd that the audience sees Gal and DeeDee in their pool, watches Bass bare-back in an orgy, witnesses a group of gangsters raiding a bathhouse/enjoying each other's company . . . but not one scene where Don Logan is located near water? In fact, the pool is empty the whole time Don Logan is present except at the end of the movie when Don is buried under the pool - now filled with water. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow many may claim the Rabbit represents death but actually it's only in the 1st and 3rd appearance of the Rabbit where its meaning is important. The 1st time it appears, of course it means Don is coming. The 2nd time it's just a red herring b/c Don is already dead and nothing happens to Gal - in fact Gal faces no consequences for his actions; he \ngets away with it! The 3rd and last time shows Don Logan buried under Gal's pool with the Rabbit kicking in his coffin as Don tells him: \"Fuck-Off!\". In short and lastly, what else could the Rabbit be but Don Logan's own sexual frustration when he's too late to do anything to appease it? And just to prove the point - Don Logan is buried under a pair of hearts - Love conquers all people, love conquers all!\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What is the meaning of the Donnie Darko like Rabbit figure in Sexy Beast","tags":["plot-explanation","sexy-beast"],"score":4,"question_id":1545,"answer_id":16917},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThis symbol is being over thought.

That is why there is an animosity between the two characters, especially since Escobar has now been promoted t\nto Lieutenant.\nI believe this movie was named \"Chinatown\" because nothing is what it appears in the Chinese district. All the prostitution, gambling dens, opium dens, etc are hidden behind legitimate businesses and organizations such as the different benevolent associations and tongs, restaurants, bars and other businesses.

And, just as it happened before, the victim of Chinatown is an innocent woman. \"Forget it, Jake.

In the film, Jake knows about the dangers of unintended consequences from past experience as he tried to help a woman previously with disastrous results.  After that, he drew the allusion between those events to Chinatown himself, a place with its own culture, language, and customs so foreign to the police that the prevailing wisdom was to do \"as little as possible\", lest accidentally doing more harm than good.

Like a lot of questions I think you can interpret it a lot of ways but after decades of watching Chinatown I'd like to inject this interpretation...\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOpening scenes of Jake's new career paint the picture of him as a pretty disreputable opportunist.  Photographing unfaithful partners and facilitating their Hollywood divorces are stereotypical examples of the work of mercenary private eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJake is a former police officer with no love lost between him and a few members of the LAPD.  The noire sensibility of the film and and the real history of the LAPD indicate that Jake was either an incredibly corrupt cop for not getting along with them, or an honest man that chose what some would view as a sketchy way to make a living rather than dealing with the hypocrisy of his former career.  The latter is what his interaction with his former colleagues seems to point to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe catalyst for the change in Jake, the tipping point, is painted ominously as events that occurred in Chinatown.  While the events are never delineated, Jake is clearly concerned about operating in that area, and people that know him know that he should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chinese characters in the film are all (with the exception of the gardener) party to the main coverup of the film.  The virtual imprisonment, including the drug induced somnolence, of Katherine occurs with either their tacit or active participation.  When Jake decides to help Evelyn and Katherine escape, it is the Chinese butler and other household staff that get enlisted in the effort to hide her from Cross, the father of both women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJake makes the choice to send them to Chinatown.  He reintroduces the moral conflict that drove him away from the police force and into his sketchy new life.  Rather than walk away from the old conflicts and uncertainties in the way that he did by hiding from them as a disinterested private eye, he confronts the old demons head on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark climax of the film reinforces the central message that fate is inescapable.  No matter what our motives or our actions the cycle of life confronts us with the consequences of our destructive nature.  \"Forget it Jake- it's Chinatown\" means there is no escaping those consequences.  Evelyn meets her doom and Jake is forced to bear witness to it instead of hide from it the way he tried to by leaving the LAPD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApologies for the long winded answer, just in case you didn't know...LOVE THIS MOVIE.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What is the meaning of the line at the end of Chinatown?","tags":["plot-explanation","analysis","dialogue","chinatown"],"score":10,"question_id":1546,"answer_id":17159},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eI think the ending of \u003cem\u003eChinatown\u003c/em\u003e is about coping with grief - and really summarises the moral struggles of Jake throughout the movie, leading us to an evaluation of guilt and self-forgiveness.

His sole desire was to merely \"scare the crap out of\n  people\". However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer\n  Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between Jared Padalecki and\n  Jensen Ackles. This revelation caused them to change the series to\n  focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly\n  monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters.\n  According to Kripke, \"...sometimes we don't even have the monster\n  until way late in the break, once we get all the angst and the drama\n  done first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eUnlike shows with \"endless mythology\" like Lost, Kripke prefers to\n  keep Supernatural's mythology simpler, saying, \"It's so hard to go\n  season after season after season with a mystery and then provide an\n  answer that's going to be satisfying.\" He prefers to have the series'\n  structure like that of the earlier X-Files episodes, having\n  mythology-based episodes spread through many self-enclosed\n  episodes—Supernatural usually having three self-enclosed episodes\n  followed by a mythology episode.

Yes, the VK test is challenged in the movie by Rachel - and that it takes very many more questions for Deckard to conclude that she is a Replicant - but that is about the extent of the analysis of the test in the movie.  One can imagine from this scenario where a Replicant with artificial human memories almost fools the test, that a human with emotional issues involving empathy may not test as a human.  However that (and the opening scene) is the extent of the use of the test in the movie - to introduce empathy as a key difference between humans and replicants, but also to blur the boundary between the two. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe novel from which the movie is loosely adapted (\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep?\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\u003c/a\u003e) the test is discussed in more detail.  In the society of the novel most animals in the world have been wiped out, and most if not all humans keep one or more animals as pets.  To not care for one or more animals would be unusual.  Deckard owns an 'electric sheep' a replica animal, but wishes he could afford a more expensive real pet and is planning to spend his bounty money on one. The fact that he has not to date put enough of a priority on owning a real animal despite his good job is a suggestion in the movie that perhaps Decard's humanity is questioned.

We are seeing things as the insane sees them. Secondly, you must understand the setting:  The U.S. failed in Vietnam because it was unable to fully commit to war in Vietnam.  In the actual war, the U.S. won virtually every battle, but failed to accomplish anything and ultimately pulled all of its troops out of the country.  That is an amazing thing if you think about it - to win all the battles, but lose the war.  Why did that happen?    Because the U.S. was confused, did not have a clear objective and was even in coflict with itself.  If you think of the U.S. as a nation, you might say, well \"that's politics.\" But what about a person who was \"confused, did not have any clear objective, and was in conflict with himself? Would you not call him insane? In the movie, the Air Cavalry Colonel who loved the smell of napalm in the morning accurately demonstrates both how capable America was of winning any battle in Vietnam and how winning those battles accomplished nothing, BECAUSE America's objectives were confused, undefined, and meaningless (insane). The air Cav Colonel fought and won a battle, very effectively, so that he could go SURFING (insane).  He had no sane objective, no concern for whether the war was won or lost, and no regard for the horror of war (insane).  Kurtz, always regarded in the movie as the one man who DID understand how to win (Precise goals and strength to endure the horror of war) was restrained by his superiors and not allowed to win - because they had the insane notion of fighting an 'ethical war' Dropping bombs on people wasn't horrific to them, but curse words were (insane).  Kurtz was NOT actually insane.  The Air Cav Colonel WAS insane, as was everyone else.  Kurtz tried and tried and tried to reach Captain Willard and show him who actually WAS insane.  Willard realized the truth, but chose to kill Kurtz and remain in the insane world rather than being outcast.  The BEAUTY of Apocalypse Now:  In an insane world, being sane is crazy.

Not as a rule, just as good business practise and convention. The reason you see unbranded goods in TV shows is simply to maintain good relations with brands, avoid potential litigation, and lastly to maintain the value of product placement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the TV industry still makes its money off of advertising, and usually their contracts are with large corporations and advertising agencies that represent hundreds or thousands of brands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo let's say a show depicts one product in a way that is detrimental to a brand, at least in the eyes of the company that makes it. It might be the case where that brand is not advertised anywhere on the network. But, the people who own that brand have other products being advertised, and they may threaten to reduce or pull the other advertising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet more likely, networks and production companies have a blanket policy of not using brands as much as possible simply to avoid potential problems. After all, if you're a network who makes money of advertisers, you want to present an image of being advertising friendly, which would mean avoiding hassles with brands \u003cem\u003ein general\u003c/em\u003e, so as to assure \u003cem\u003efuture\u003c/em\u003e advertisers of a safe harbour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also the potential for litigation. If a show depicts a brand as being wildly harmful to people or characters, then a company might even go so far as to sue for damages in the form of lost sales. Or, if a brand is shown in a way that can be used dangerously in real life (like \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMythbusters\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e making a bomb out of a detergent), the show might even face criminal charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of legislation is a rarity, but if it does happen, it could be disastrous, and lawyers are a risk adverse bunch, so their advice to networks and production companies is to just not risk it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in short, the reason you don't usually see brand names in shows is because the networks and production houses are playing it \"better safe than sorry\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, there's maintaining the value of product placement. By removing all real life brands from a show, then when you do show a brand, it has value you can sell to an advertiser. If you're Coke, you might be less inclined to advertise on a show where a character was seen last week drinking a Pepsi, and Pepsi didn't have to pay for it.

It should have been utterly trivial for Sheldon, as an accomplished string theorist (and genius) to do this properly, so I just have  hard time believing that he'd been struggling with it.

Five years later, a movie poster for the Lumiere Brothers’ “Arrival of a Train” in 1895 was the first to depict an actual scene from the film. However, up until the early 1910s, the majority of early film posters were nothing more than simple “broadside” style signs with little more than block text.

We get to see Travolta at his very best - good acting, a funny and dramatic plot, and he gets to remind us that he can dance a little. Coupled with the more comedic moments with Jules book ending the movie, his character is arguably the most prominent in a very well regarded movie.  As Nobby also points out, the role of Vincent Vega as drug-taking hitman is vastly different from the roles he normally takes, particularly the role of James in the \u003cem\u003eLook Who's Talking\u003c/em\u003e movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Travolta's position as a fading star coupled with him being attached to such a prominent role in such a well regarded movie is the reason why this is remembered as the movie that re-launched his career.

The movie has a lot of accuracy in regards to Iraq, the war and our troops- basically, their struggle in that atmosphere. Very few movies about Iraq are this good with the exception of American Sniper and a few others. Anyways, I agree this is a confusing aspect of the movie and for so long I figured the insurgents had placed another child there to confuse the main character but my opinion has since changed. In my opinion (and that is what it all comes down to), Beckham- the little Iraqi boy who sells DVD's on the base- was never actually killed. Confusion and combat stress go hand and hand, causing sergeant James to make erroneous and reckless decisions (lets face it, he was kind of reckless from the beginning). The likelihood that another boy could look and sound equally like Beckham is unlikely. So my thoughts are that insanity and stress were getting the best of the main character. His relationship and compassion for the boy, while noble and heartwarming, was jeopardizing his relationship and the safety of himself and his troops. So there you have it, insanity and mistaken identity were the culprits in this one. Sorry for the long response but I love this movie and I was over there in northern Iraq, Mosul to be exact, once too.

Made in 1948, \u003cem\u003eDrunken Angel\u003c/em\u003e was just one of a number of films that dealt with the state of post-war Japan, but this was one that did not feature any G.I.s or any other characters normally associated with films from that era. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRather than link to a bunch of external essays, if you'll permit me the indulgence, I'll add some text from one of my own papers that I wrote during some film history classes that focused on Kurosawa. I think this extract highlights one of the reasons why \u003cem\u003eDrunken Angel\u003c/em\u003e is so admired. The emphasis has been added by me for this answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e*\u003cem\u003eThe master/pupil relationship that Kurosawa has created in Drunken Angel (1948) is a complicated one. Sanada (played by Takashi Shimura) is the titular character, a doctor who strives to help others, but has his own, drink induced, problems. Matsunaga (played by Toshiro Mifune) is his unwitting pupil, a gangster on the cusp of death through tuberculosis, masking his fear with staggering bravado.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe festering sump pool on Sanada’s doorstep, a metaphor for the decay in post-war Japan and the state of Matsunaga’s lungs\u003c/strong\u003e, links these men and it is often referred to by Sanada when he is trying to make a point to the younger man.\nWhen Sanada diagnoses Matsunaga’s illness, the young gangster is horrified, but this manifests itself as anger toward the doctor. Sanada knows he cannot cure the younger man’s T.B., but he takes it upon himself to try to cure him psychologically, showing him the error of his criminal ways and perhaps attempting to make amends for his slump into alcoholism through Matsunaga.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSanada’s methods employ a form of tough love when it comes to tending to Matsunaga’s wounds. He is brutal when he takes a bullet out of the gangster’s hand, making him suffer and showing him the consequences of the yakuza way of life. Eventually Matsunaga begins to understand the doctor’s teachings, and this is hammered home when Okada is released from prison and Matsunaga is demoted in the gang.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen Matsunaga discovers that Sanada is living with Miyo (played by Chieko Nakakita), Okada’s old moll, he sees a chance for redemption, protecting his mentor but giving up his life in the process. \u003cstrong\u003eUltimately, Sanada’s teachings were all about willpower.

There was an interesting way to go; what I decided to do was give it to Hans and let him run with it and see if in some way it might inform elements of the score, because we always knew, we talked in early conversations about how towards the action climax of the film, there was going to be a need for the score to interweave seamlessly with this source cue, which is and extremely difficult technical thing to do. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat quote doesn't explain why that particular song was chosen, but it does explain that the song was chosen early in the writing process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I don't think it's necessary to get a straight answer from Nolan to this question.

Here's what I wrote (hope it will be useful):\nThe opening sequence was designed by Santa Monica based Elastic design studio director Angus Wall working along with The Rock Paper Scissors group. Wall is an acclaimed film editor and title designer that rose to prominence during the 90's when he worked for David Fincher as his lead editorial consultant. The main function of the title sequence was to help the audience orient themselves within complex plots that affect and intertwine each other in the giant fictional world of Westeros and Essos. Elastic team was to introduce the world's maps and geography to the viewer, but also to avoid standard tropes for fantasy maps - aged parchment with Medieval-like inscriptions presented in the candle light. And although Tolkien maps of Middle-Earth was their starting point inspiration, whey had to move away from this kind of depiction. \n    The breakthrough happened when the design process moved from Middle Ages to more enlightened ones. Decorated initials and vignettes were exchanged for Da Vinci's sketches and models. The digitally created clockwork universe was born. To stay away from both – the archaic belief of flat earth  and the illuminated spherical earth models – Angus Wall and his team created an inverted world that surfaces on the inside of a sphere. To marry helio- and geocentric models of the universe, the sun is placed in the centre of the world, within a celestial armillary sphere. What's surprising, the sun itself became a flat object – a disc constrained within the innermost ring of the astrolabe, rotating within the machine. Rings of the astrolabe are engraved with scenes from Westeros history that occurred prior to the action in the books and the tv series – three of those are shown – the Targaryen invasion of Westeros (burning city, dragon and an army), Robert's Rebellion (a wolf, a lion and a stag killing a three-headed dragon) and Robert's ride to power (a stag with a halo with other animals paying homage to it). \"We cut to those three times in the title sequence, so you actually see a history of Westeros and Essos. The third time we see all the animals [representing] the different houses bowing down to the Baratheon stag, which brings us to the present, where there's a Baratheon king. We wanted to be very, very faithful to the book because we knew there would be a large fan base that will be looking at this very carefully,\" says Angus Wall.\n    In the digitally-created environment, the camera (or rather illusion of it) swoops down from the sun towards the surface of the map (speeded up with few lens snicks – another invention for the mechanism-themed opening). At the surface, a single cogwheel with a crest starts to turn and the whole clockwork model of a city emerges from the ground. The camera travels from place to place, showing more cities and castles, each being erected in the like manner. This part represents the ruling houses with their machinations being the propelling force of “Game of Thrones” world. Also, it informs the viewer where the action of the episode will take place. This creates an unprecedented result, as the opening scores animation evolves from episode to episode as multiple plots develop. In the first season alone there is four varying openings, or “map paths”. The rest of the map is a topographic representation in 3D, having distinct angular shapes (contour intervals are presented literally) and small amount of features, generalised only to main roads (lines), forests (green spiked pyramids) and rocks (grey polygons). Names of notable places are integral part of the map, the style of the font resembles quill and ink writing, similar one to the one used in Tolkien maps for “Lord of the Rings”.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"In the title sequence, what is the strange futuristic noise/blinking effect?","tags":["game-of-thrones","sound-effects","title-sequence"],"score":-2,"question_id":2013,"answer_id":19002},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eIn fact, from what I have seen, that blinking effect comes from the globe that shows up between the map shots at the scene.

In order to expose Angelique as a witch, Collins had to crack her neck, and show that she didn't die, but was instead made of glass and a hollow exterior. It was a very dramatic moment in the movie, and worked rather well to build up to the ultimate fight they had. It also supported the idea that she didn't have a heart- until she pulled it out and watched it shatter as she died. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy only question to add to this is that if she were hollow and made of glass, how is it that Collins didn't recognize it right away when he met her? Would her flesh really have been warm like a human's? Would she have a pulse? If one knocked on her, would she sound hollow? It doesn't really matter to the overall plot, but I am rather curious. :)\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why did the witch crack like porcelain?","tags":["dark-shadows"],"score":-1,"question_id":2306,"answer_id":10765},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eFrom an \u003ca href=\"http://movies.inquirer.net/3889/eva-green-a-vengeful-witch-in-dark-shadows-opens-may-10\"\u003einterview\u003c/a\u003e with Eva Green (who played Angelique):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eI’ve always been a fan of Tim’s,” Green says. “He’s so creative, but\n  also open to suggestions, which is wonderful for an actor.

So if the end of the film is reality, then how is his setting that of a rural, seaside home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnswering directly, I believe that Cobb isn't in any specific level of dream, he's simply lost in the vast maze of his own consciousness. He's simply trapped within his own world, lost to reality after what he reaches what he thinks is his goal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003eBut it could also be argued that he was in the real world because of the children's ages. If you stick around for the credits, you can see that two sets of children were used to act out James and Phillipa. But it's simply a technicality, the film achieves a lot more deph if Cobb is stuck in the dream. If he had been 'incepted'. \u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"At which dream level did Inception end?","tags":["plot-explanation","ending","inception"],"score":5,"question_id":2324,"answer_id":15517},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eAlthough the ending of inception was meant to be debatable and ultimately was left up to the audience, there are several factors indicating that Cobb is indeed dreaming in the end of the film. In fact if you read my whole theory you shall understand that Cobb is actually on the third dream level and you will understand why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReason 1. Cobb told Saito and Ariadne how his totem works therefore he can never truly tell if he is inside one of their dreams. In the end of the movie the totem DID fall down, but it was a dream. (This is because the totem was corrupted; the whole purpose of a totem is that it's functions are known only to you and no one else. When you are in someone else's dream and they know how your totem works they can use it against you, therefore making it impossible to tell if you are dreaming.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReason 2. When Cobb met his children at the end of the film after he spun the top he asked his son what he was building and his son replied \"A house on a cliff.\" This is A HUGE factor because we all know that throughout the movie elements of the subconscious work their way through to the dream; ie, Mal who was a projection. The relevance of the \"house on a cliff\" is that Saito lived in a house on a cliff in Limbo. If you remember when Cobb washed up on shore to the beach in Limbo he looked up and saw a house on a cliff. The son saying this is not a coincidence because there is no way he would have known that Saito lived in a house on a cliff. Therefore Cobb is inside Saito's dream hence the elements of the subconscious working its way to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReason 3. The reason the screen to suddenly cut to black and possibly the reason for the top to take so long to fall was due to the end of the third dream. The dream was collapsing and it in fact ended. This is because of the song Je ne regrette rien. It was played in the dreams to indicate when the dream was ending. When the song ended so did the dream. The song was 2 minutes and 28 seconds long. The movie Inception was EXACTLY 2 hours and 28 minutes to the exact second (check if you want). This means that the ending was a dream but it was the end of the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReason 4. Why did Saito and Cobb end up in the third dream level? Well everytime someone dies in a dream within a dream they awake up one dream level. When Cobb and Saito shot themselves they died in Limbo and awoke in the third dream level which is one level higher than Limbo. However why did they wake up on the plane? Simple. It is not the plane and they did not \"WAKE UP\". Going back, you must keep in mind that Cobb and Saito missed the series of kicks that would allow them to leave the dream. So with everyone gone and Cobb and Saito still in Limbo, only EMPTY DREAM SPACE REMAINS, waiting for the first mind to make contact with it. Then Saito killed himself followed by Cobb. Saito was first and so his subconscious populated and inhabited the third dream level. The reason he \"wakes up on a plane\" is because he believed himself to be on a plane and so his subconscious built the plane from his memory along with the projections of his team. When Cobb entered right after he was entering a dream that belonged to Saito and therefore because it looked like reality he couldn't tell if it was a dream or not. Also his totem is \"broken\" so there is no telling whether he is dreaming or not. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReason 5. After Saito and Cobb leave the plane and enter the airport they never once talk to the other \"members of their team\". This 1 dimensional characteristic was commonly used before from the projections in the various dream levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"At which dream level did Inception end?","tags":["plot-explanation","ending","inception"],"score":22,"question_id":2324,"answer_id":12596},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eI know that we can all agree that the ending is up in the air, but were he dreaming in the end, what dream level he is in, can be one of at least two possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1st level: Although we are introduced to the spinning totem early on in the film and further enlightened to its significance throughout, we only see it spin out once, in the hotel room before Cobb and Arthur catch the helicopter.

When he washes upon the shores at the end, he is washing up on the shores of his and Saido's subconscious.

Yes it is an interesting theory, but whilst it is certainly a deliberate action from the writers/director - the meaning is not completely clear.

Apart from production design geeks, it doesn't make sense to me that an audience would choose to go see a movie for some fancy interfaces. They aren't a centerpiece like big action sequences or character development, they're typically a means to an end. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in most cases, that end does require technology that is different from realistic modern-day tech. Chances are, if someone is looking at a screen or an interface in a movie or TV show, there is important information being relayed, either about something happening in the character's world or about how the character is solving the problem. \"Fancy technology\" may be more visually pleasing to look at, but it's also more suited to get the most important plot information across quickly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstant plot communication:\u003c/strong\u003e Half a season of Doctor Who revolved around this kind of instantly legible technology. The show was able to use a highly stylized pregnancy scan screen to bring up a recurring storyline in seconds. Disregarding how incongruous a Earth operating system would seem on the TARDIS, anything with a similar workaday tech aesthetic wouldn't have handled the storyline as well. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter development:\u003c/strong\u003e Using John Smith's background of the MCU, a perfect example of \"fancy technology\" performing important character development is \u003cem\u003eThe Avengers\u003c/em\u003e. Tony Stark's most important character trait is how he thinks. The movies wouldn't be engaging without all of the scenes where he is doing nothing but inventing or figuring out a problem on his own. As for why technology is important to making that interesting, compare the scenes of him inventing the suit for the first time with later scenes back in America with Jarvis. Technology makes being alone interesting and allows the audience into his thought process, without forcing Pepper to constantly be his exposition buddy. It allows a whole new character and humor dynamic to emerge. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIllustrating relationships:\u003c/strong\u003e Granted, I can't think of a good example of this outside of \u003cem\u003eThe Avengers\u003c/em\u003e but their use of technology is my favorite. Twice in the movie, technology helps hit emotional points in cleaner, quicker and more effective ways than other methods. First is when Stark and Banner are first interacting trying to chase down the cube (I think, I'm fuzzy on their objective). Stark and Banner are two geniuses, and showing how they work together, and how Stark continues to push Banner as they work is an essential part of their storyline and best told through tech. That moment when Stark minimizes all of the windows on the transparent glass display is perfect. In the same movie, Stark attempting to call Pepper one last time before his sacrifice, with that portrait of her inside his helmet, is more affecting than an actual conversation would have been because it allows the audience member to fill in the emotional dots. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDefining worlds:\u003c/strong\u003e Sorry, I keep coming up with examples from the Marvel universe. Their use of tech is on point. It is important for the MCU that the Asgardians aren't actually magic or gods, they're just highly advanced aliens. This is made clear in \u003cem\u003eThor: Dark World\u003c/em\u003e when Jane Foster is entranced by the interface of the medical technology used to help her. When they tell her it's a \"soul forge\", she figures out the underlying science and describes it in terms of human technology. It's a great moment for showing what kind of a thinker and person she is, and it shows that the Asgardians are just highly advanced, not magical. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these more pointed, plot-oriented uses of technology would be impossible or highly difficult. Iron Man doesn't have Android installed on his suits not because people would get bored and spend less money on his movies, but because Android wouldn't tell his story as well.

The Captain's wear the peacoat looking uniforms. On the far left in the green is the Fleet Commander in charge of Earth Defense Command. All Earthbound EDF/EDC members wear the green uniforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite with Blue usually indicates individuals in the Sciences divisions. Sandor is referred to as 'Chief', so it is assumable that he is the head of the Sciences division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite with Green is the 'Tactical' division. Navigation (Mark Venture leads this division). This also includes communications and tactical, including Nova/Yuki and Homer (communications officer), who both at times sport the Yellow and Black uniform. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite with Orange is 'Environmental'. This includes Engineering personnel primarily, lead by Chief Orion. Orion is the only member of Avatar's Command Ship crew from the failed battle at Pluto to serve aboard Yamato/Argo. It is he that helps Wildstar come to the realization of what truly happened at Pluto, and the fact Avatar also lost his daughter in that battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite with Red Cross is, obviously, medical personnel. This included Mimi the Rescue Cat, Dr. Sane (with his omni-present sake/\"spring water\") and when serving in her Nurse capacitiy, Nova/Yuki. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlack with Yellow would eventually become the signature of the Cosmos/Black Tigers squadron. Early in the series most of the pilots aside from Conroy ('Second in command of your fighters' he intros himself in the early eps) sported the White and Red of Command. Later in the series, all pilots other than Wildstar sported the proud Black and Gold of the Cosmos Tigers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite and Red is Command and Control.

I'm hard pressed to think of any relationship between the structure of the film's story and the structure of \u003cem\u003eThe Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\u003c/em\u003e. The musical piece is structured as a \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_%28music%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etheme and variations\u003c/a\u003e, which the spoken narration briefly refers to. Such a work begins with a theme (either an original one or one by another composer, as is the case here) and then is followed by a set of variations, in which the composer alters the original theme in various ways. In \u003cem\u003eThe Young Person's Guide\u003c/em\u003e, Britten uses the different variations to showcase different instruments in the orchestra. In Britten's Variations on a Theme by Frank Bridge, he turns a strain composed by one of his music teachers into a classical minuet, a Viennese waltz, an Italian opera fanfare, and a somber funeral march, among other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a film to take the structure of a theme and variations, it would have to be very episodic, moving from one character or set of characters to another and having each vignette somehow reflect the main plot. I've seen \u003cem\u003eMoonrise Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e several times, and I don't detect this structure at work. The situations of Suzy's parents, Scoutmaster Ward, Captain Sharp, the other Khaki Scouts, etc. don't really mirror Sam and Suzy's romance in any appreciable way. I'm sure there's a film out there that is structured as a theme and variations, but it's not coming to mind at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the structure of \u003cem\u003eThe Young Person's Guide\u003c/em\u003e doesn't reflect the structure of the movie, then what's it doing in the movie? Well, Wes Anderson is apparently a longtime Britten fan who performed in a production of Britten's opera \u003cem\u003eNoye's Fludde\u003c/em\u003e when he was 10 or 11. He said that he began the film with a notion that Britten's music should be used to illustrate this story. Most of the other Britten selections he found for the film, but \u003cem\u003eThe Young Person's Guide\u003c/em\u003e is one of Britten's most popular works. (The composer wrote a great deal of music for children.) It makes sense to begin the film with a piece that's well-known. It's also logical, within the story, that Suzy's parents would have this record in their house for their children to listen to. The music makes a backdrop to the opening credit sequence, in which we're introduced to Suzy and the members of her family. Visually, the sequence does emphasize how each member of her family is occupying a different space in their house, which chimes with the psychic distance between Suzy's mother and father, and between Suzy and her parents. All this to music in which Britten compartmentalizes the different sections of the orchestra. We then hear the music again near the end of the movie, when Suzy is back with her family. Specifically, we hear the end of the piece, when all the instruments in the orchestra once again play together. \u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Moonrise Kingdom: What is the significance of Benjamin Britten\u0026#39;s \u0026quot;The Young Person\u0026#39;s Guide to the Orchestra\u0026quot;?","tags":["analysis","plot-explanation","moonrise-kingdom","wes-anderson"],"score":4,"question_id":2554,"answer_id":3031}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8765}

But the second is directed further downstream, closer to where Joyce and Shears are lying. What the audience sees is that it knocks over Nicholson and another Japanese soldier. (The audience is watching Nicholson, wondering whether he will try to press the plunger himself, and whether he will make it.) What the women see is that Warden directs the shot at his two fallen comrades. Warden has entirely lost interest in the bomb, he just wants to make sure no member of the team is taken alive. \"Madness\" indeed. And the move was apparently effective.

When businesses pay for product placement, they also specify there will not be a similar competitor's product in the same movie.  So isn't it funny that in some movies such as Independence Day, you only see prominent cigar smoking and no cigarettes.  This strongly looks like big money is at stake.

But if you look at it as an “our children are misbehaving down there” scenario, there are moments where it looks like we’ve gone out of control, running around with armor and skirts, which of course would be the Roman Empire. And they were given a long run. A thousand years before their disintegration actually started to happen. And you can say, \"Let's send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it.\" Guess what? They crucified him.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. The reason the Engineers don't like us any more is that they made us a Space Jesus, and we broke him. Reader, that's not me pulling wild ideas out of my arse.

Presumably through the black slime, which evidently models its behaviour on the user's mental state. Create unselfishly, accepting self-destruction as the cost, and the black stuff engenders fertile life. But expose the potent black slimy stuff to the thoughts and emotions of flawed humanity, and 'the sleep of reason produces monsters'. We never see the threat that the Engineers were fleeing from, we never see them killed other than accidentally (decapitation by door), and we see no remaining trace of whatever killed them. Either it left a long time ago, or it reverted to inert black slime, waiting for a human mind to reactivate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe black slime reacts to the nature and intent of the being that wields it, and the humans in the film didn't even know that they WERE wielding it. That's why it remained completely inert in David's presence, and why he needed a human proxy in order to use the stuff to create anything. The black goo could read no emotion or intent from him, because he was an android.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eShaw's comment when the urn chamber is entered - 'we've changed the atmosphere in the room' - is deceptively informative. The psychic atmosphere has changed, because humans - tainted, Space Jesus-killing humans - are present. The slime begins to engender new life, drawing not from a self-sacrificing Engineer but from human hunger for knowledge, for more life, for more everything. Little wonder, then, that it takes serpent-like form. The symbolism of a corrupting serpent, turning men into beasts, is pretty unmistakeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eRefusal to accept death is anathema to the Engineers. Right from the first scene, we learned their code of willing self-sacrifice in accord with a greater purpose. When the severed Engineer head is temporarily brought back to life, its expression registers horror and disgust. Cinemagoers are confused when the head explodes, because it's not clear why it should have done so. Perhaps the Engineer wanted to die again, to undo the tainted human agenda of new life without sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"What was the motivation behind the Engineers actions in Prometheus?","tags":["plot-explanation","prometheus"],"score":9,"question_id":2748,"answer_id":4172},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eWatching this video made me think of Prometheus.  \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n-tTst-vyQ\u0026amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n-tTst-vyQ\u0026amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\u003c/a\u003e\nI think the engineers were a type 1 civilization or were attempting to get to a type 2 civilization, they clearly had a mastery and understanding of the galaxy.

I think the best twist on this is that they had a conflict between the engineeers (science) and another group, whether equal and internal (warrior clan) or engineered, external replicas of some sort that rebelled and tried to kill their creator.  I also think that they used the black goo on several worlds, in one version it created the xenomorph, in another it created us.  To them, perhaps, we are the same as the xenomorph, who would destroy them in similar fashion.  So that was why they were trying to destroy us with their own biological weapons, although that might be too intricate.  Clearly focusing on the themes is the solution: fathers and children, the Greek theme of Prometheus, of stealing fire (the first engineer creating life on earth and man becoming capable of such worldly destruction) and the relationship with death and the eternal question of the source of life, must be explored.

David has the yellow hair and wears shades of cool blue and cool gray that is also tied into the ship's design.  Meredith likewise has the same color scheme.  They are both hardware just like the ship.  She walks like David.  She is strong like David, and she doesn't display human compassion like when she burns up Charlie (Elizabeth tells David her compassion is the reason that she is human and he isn't).  There will be those who say, what about the other scientists who had blonde hair?  But those scientists were seen yacking after cryosleep or slumped over; and they weren't given the prominence Meredith was given.  Meredith wasn't.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the subtext in the film is that David knows she is an android and she doesn't know it, just like Rachael in Blade Runner.  David gets a kick out of her trying to establish her human superiority over his robotic inferiority (when she threatens to cut his cord) because he has intimate knowledge of her fabrication.  The look on his face is that he wants to tell her but his orders prevent it.  When we see David getting his orders from Weyland about \"Try harder\" -- it was evident by the skewn composition that we were seeing it from someone else's point-of-view.  But the point of view was detached and withdrawn.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, it involved a level of stealth that clearly verged on predatory or suprahuman.  Then the revelation was that Charlize Theron was the individual who had snuck up on him and was watching him.   When is a human character in a Ridley Scott film ever able to sneak up on a non-human character in such a predatory way unless it was alien or android?  In this scene, the power is clearly Charlize Theron's.  Not just in her actions but in the way Scott codes her as a silent stealthy creature.  It's clear that David and Meredith are related in ways the others are not related because their movement, their mannerisms, and their attitudes are synchronized.  As actors, they are playing off each other, so Theron tries to humanize Meredith in a way that is far more advanced than David.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, we can see the expressions in Weyland's face that when she tries to use emotional pleas for him not to go and see the Giant, that her emotional pleas ring hollow.  Firstly, it's the way she says father -- though it's an appeal to emotion, it is awkwardly uttered and awkwardly timed.  She was directed to say the line as if it lacked proper emotion.  As if it were the thing to say.  Only a machine that lacked emotion but were trying to find a way to make an emotional appeal based on its programming would do so in such an apathetic manner.   Weyland's physical reaction is that her appeals ring hollow because he knows she is a hollow woman at her core.  Far more advanced and emotionally sophisticated but not sophisticated enough.  Some argue that Weyland's quest for eternal life from the Giants might be motivated by his dream to create an emotionally exact replica of human life in the form of a robot.  So although Theron is far more advanced than David, she still has room for refinement.  That her last name is Vickers is simply Weylan'ds way of giving her an additional level of identity separate from David's.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn an exegetical note -- whenever a magician says pay not attention over here, then there's something there that he really wants you to see, and it's a form of reverse psychology in the art of misdirection.  Likewise, the text tried to dismiss the question of whether or not that she was an android in such an obvious way that it was like c'mon 97% of what I have seen codes her as an android, and you want me to place that 3% in the form of dialogue over what my eyes have seen?  I'm sorry, people lie with their words all the time; I will trust my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don't buy Lindelof's answer.  Scott supercede's Lindelof as a director.  The history of his work indicates that Meredith is an android.  He codes her as such, frames her as such, has her walk and talk and posture as such.  She moves silently as such.  She could be the Terminatrix.  If she were definitely human, than ambiguity would not be necessary.  If she were android, ambiguity is understandable.  I think Scott is smarter than that.  So my answer is yes, she is an android.  Until Scott himself says 'no.'  If she is not an android, then I will be the first to admit that I was wrong.  But I don't see why a smart director allows for that level of ambiguity.  I think she is in such denial of her robotic nature that she needs to prove her humanity.  Having sex does not mean she is not an android.  Androids have simulated sex in Scott's films before.  And David could be the android that does his physical (dark bidding), and Meredith could be the one that does his corporate bidding.  He can use them as different aspects of his will seeing as how a man with secrets like himself can't trust anything he can't control.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"In Prometheus, is Meredith Vickers a human or android?","tags":["character","prometheus"],"score":3,"question_id":2787,"answer_id":2881},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThink like a writer..not like the story is real as one post did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSHE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT A ROBOT.\nWe know this through the writing technique used.

He is only able to save the boy before he himself falls after Dent.

Batman is not just telling Gordon that he killed Dent he is saying that he killed those people. Batman feels directly responsible for their death and in Harvey's case is directly responsible. This is the true genius of Nolan's Batman, he not only made him real and plausible he makes him constantly trying to figure out what he's doing, why is he doing it and has he gone to far? He made Batman break his most important rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of fans don't want to admit that Batman killed. An accidental killing doesn't count as breaking his rule they say, but to Batman it does count. It will haunt him. The deaths Two-Face caused will haunt him. HE takes the blame for everything that happened. He pushed Two-Face off of a building and he died. The line has been crossed. How will he deal with it? How will he deal with being a criminal? The next movie will definitely deal with this but it is a huge step for Batman. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNolan has created a realistic Batman. In the first movie we get to see what makes a man become a Batman. What training, what psychological problems, what Gotham's corruption had to do with it. When fighting Ra's al Ghul we start to see a bending of his rule not to kill. Leaving Ra's al Ghul on the train is not killing in his mind because Ra's al Ghul has survived a seemingly unsurvivable situation before plus he's planned meticulously. If Batman can survive it he assumes Ra's al Ghul can as well. Now at the start of the second movie we start to encounter a basic problem with his rule, if Batman doesn't kill why do criminals need to fear him? By the end of the movie Batman has killed and he's taken the blame for more killings. This not only adds to the myth of the Batman but it directly affects the mental state of Batman. All of the second movie we see him wrestling with how far he should push himself, what is his limit, what keeps him from being the Joker? Then he breaks his most important rule and it seems to define him more. Did he plan to kill Two-Face no. Did he directly cause his death yes! He did it in the only allowable way to protect the innocent and by accident but he still killed and broke his rule. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow we have a whole new Batman going into the third movie.

The simple construct with a mild sedative and the more complex construct with a strong sedative. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the simple construct, one kick is enough. Kick can be either to the self (eg: Arthur shot in the head) \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e a kick from above (eg: Cobb dunked in bath tub). The sedative is light so there is no synchronization required. In real life this can be equated to sleeping and dreaming about falling, the fall in the dream wakes us up. Alternately someone wakes you up by pushing you off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a strong sedative, complex construct dream - a single kick is not going to be enough. A person needs two synchronized at the same instant. One kick to the self and one from the level above. The synchronization is done using music. In the real world, this can be equated to being under total anesthesia. Neither would a bad dream fall wake you up nor would pushing you off the operating table. The reel part here is that if some how pushing you off the table can be coincided with the fall in your dream, you can wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the act of inception on Fischer's mind, they are in a complex heavily sedated dream. The only viable kick here is falling because death will take you to limbo. As mentioned in another answer, waiting it out is not going to work because weeks and months would need to pass in the lower layers. Waiting it out is a possible option only in the first layer because there is limited time dilation. Also a single kick from a level above or jumping off a cliff in the current level wont work as a kick. The dreamer is far too sedated for that. A person needs to fall in the current level and the level above simultaneously so so they plan. The following kicks (falls) are planned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLevel 1 : Van Falling\u003cbr\u003e\nLevel 2 : Falling by one floor (blowing up the floor)\u003cbr\u003e\nLevel 3 (inception level) : Falling from the building (blowing up the structure)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, things don't go as plan. Hence they improvise on the kicks.\nHere is the set of synchronized kicks that each one receives per level of dream.\nPoint to note, no two people receive the same two kick pairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere's the image from the link:\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RtwC1.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, other than dying in limbo, everything else needs a pair of synchronized kicks.

Because of the sedatives, dying wasn't an option; they'd just end up in limbo. And because of the multiple dream levels, waiting for the timer to run out wasn't an option, because they'd all be killed by the projections in the time involved. Kicks were the only way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it was clear from the movie that there was a definite problem with kicks coming too soon. I don't think the exact consequences were made clear, but we can deduce some things. If it's a two-level dream, in the first level is one awake guy (the first-level dreamer) and some number of sleeping people who are in the second level dream. If a kick comes in the first level, the first-level dreamer is \u003cem\u003edefinitely\u003c/em\u003e going to wake up. We can assume that, at least under the sedated dream we saw in the movie, the remaining dreamers don't also wake. Otherwise there wouldn't be a problem; the top-level kick would have woken them all the way down the chain! So for the kick to wake you \u003cem\u003efrom\u003c/em\u003e the first level, you have to be awake \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e the first level. This may be a consequence of the sedative, and not a general rule of dreaming. Or it may be a function of the differing time scales; if time is moving subjectively faster on the lower levels, what would seem like a sudden acceleration one level up might subjectively be too slow for you to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happens if the first-level kick comes while you're still in the second level? The guy dreaming the first level just woke up, so if you wake up from the second level after that, what are you waking up \u003cem\u003eto\u003c/em\u003e? Limbo seems the most likely consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo the kicks needed to be as late as possible, to have as much time as possible to complete the mission. But they still needed to come in a definite order, to avoid limbo. Thus the tight synchronization required. But they are definitely not simultaneous, as the question asks.

Would Mal have tried to kill Arthur because he was the dreamer? Could she/ other projections killed Saito and Arthur instead? Would Mal exist in such a scenario? What would happen to Cobb's subconscious that existed till then in that level? Did the dream start collapsing only because Arthur was the architect and does that mean what you've created only will get destroyed? One thing we should know is that when you see other persons subconscious in your dream, it automatically becomes your subconscious too, but you know that it doesn't belong to you.

At the first level (van ride one), they probably would have kicked Fischer in such a way that he would wake up a little later after they wake up - so that no one doubts anything has happened.

It would be great fun to see these characters crossing paths as they regularly do in the comics, but the big screen reality is complicated due to different movie studios owning the movie rights to these cash cow franchises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe record-setting box office take of The Avengers proved that audiences crave this kind of movie team-up, and the subject of crossovers has been addressed by various parties in the past year or so. Hugh Jackman publicly mused that he’d love to share the screen with Robert Downey, Jr.’s Iron Man (and “kick his ass.”), X-Men franchise producer Lauren Shuler Donner loves the idea of an X-Men/Avengers team-up,  and while Marvel Studios President of Production Kevin Feige essentially told everyone not to hold their breath, fans continue to wonder if it could someday happen.\nIf it was up to Avi Arad, however, Spider-Man and the Avengers would never meet on the silver screen. Arad is a former Marvel Studios executive and remains a producer on the studio’s various films, with a focus on Sony’s rebooted The Amazing Spider-Man franchise. Arad and producer Matthew Tolmach recently spoke to TotalFilm (via CBM) about the possibility.\nHere’s what Arad had to say:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I for one don’t see the value for us in it. I think we’re doing such a good job with the Spider-Man Universe. Spider-Man is arguably the number one character in the world. He shouldn’t make a cameo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eArad appears to have retracted his position a bit, though, having later said that the idea would be possible if they found:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“a natural alliance for some reason…I cannot talk for Sony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Arad is clearly not speaking for the studio, which might mean the possibility remains alive. Still, Tolmach – who produced The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and is working on the Venom and Sinister Six spinoffs – chimed in with his point of view:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The practical side of it is, look, how many movies have we just talked about? It’s all we can do to build that universe. We’re not going beyond that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a practical, pragmatic point of view, it’s true that Sony, Arad, Tolmach and the rest of the creative team involved in developing a shared movie universe based on The Amazing Spider-Man have their hands full and plenty of characters and storylines to work with without negotiating with Marvel Studios or Fox about how and where they’ll be able to merge onscreen. Not to mention navigating the various schedules, salaries – and egos – of the stars of the franchises involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Arad’s comment on the “value” - he’s speaking about the studio and it’s willingness (or lack thereof) to share the profits and spotlight with any other franchise or studio. There would be tremendous value for fans of the characters and movies, and a potentially rewarding opportunity for the writers and directors to explore the facets of these different franchises. It’s very clear, however, that the Spider-Man, X-Men and Avengers movie universes are heading in very different directions. A crossover on this scale could happen in some form, eventually, but don’t expect it anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? Do you want to see Spider-Man and the Avengers meet up on the big screen?\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What would have to happen to merge the Spider-man franchise and the Avengers franchise?","tags":["the-avengers","marvel-cinematic-universe","spider-man","crossovers"],"score":-4,"question_id":2948,"answer_id":31104},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eFilm corporation collaborations are not as uncommon as one might believe. This is especially true when dealing with music or music artists signed to one label that is under the umbrella of another corporation. Granted in those cases the film corporation really tries to pull music and artists from under it's own parent company labels but such is not ALWAYS possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise when taking characters it always depends on what the film companies are willing to do. In that case it's always going to come down to money. Who gets what portion. This involves actors, screenwriters, and of course franchise owners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe best example of this is \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" which gave us the first appearance of \"Bugs Bunny\" and \"Mickey Mouse\" on the screen at the same time. And the blood between Warner and Disney over animation was always HIGHLY hostile. (More talent theft than you see between Google, Apple, and Microsoft)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, while collaborations aren't rare; what they collaborate over can be far more rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, to answer the question, sometimes it's a contractual buyout of the franchise/character. Sometimes it's a character loan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned in other responses, after months of deliberation, in February of 2015, Sony and the MCU announced an agreement to allow Spiderman to appear in upcoming MCU films.

After\n  an episode between the couple when Kristen turns down a marriage\n  proposal from James, they receive a knock at the front door from a\n  blonde woman. \"Is Tamara home?\", she asks. \"No, I think you have the\n  wrong house\", they tell her. The mysterious woman then walks off into\n  the night. James leaves the house to go buy cigarettes and get his\n  mind off of things. Meanwhile, Kristen stays at the house alone. The\n  blonde woman returns, asking for Tamara, but this time Kristen does\n  not open the door; \"You already came by here\", she tells the woman,\n  who responds with \"Are you sure?\". The smoke alarm goes off soon\n  after, due to the fireplace being blocked, and Kristen pulls the alarm\n  off the ceiling and it clatters to the floor. Someone begins banging\n  at the door. Kristen, a little unnerved at the entire situation, locks\n  the doors in the house, and calls James asking him to hurry back, when\n  the phone line goes dead. Kristen plugs her cell phone in to charge\n  it, changes into jeans and a flannel shirt, and then picks up a\n  half-smoked cigarette. As she stands in the living room of the house,\n  a man wearing a sack mask emerges from the hallway behind her, and\n  watches her silently as she gets a glass of water. He then disappears.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eAnother barrage of knocks come from the front door, and Kristen sees\n  the smoke alarm, which was previously lying on the floor, sitting\n  neatly on the center of a dining room chair. She hurries to grab her\n  cell phone, but it has been taken off the charger and is nowhere in\n  sight. She hears something hitting the windchimes and making a\n  dragging noise on the back patio, and she slowly, armed with a kitchen\n  knife, walks toward the sliding glass door. She pulls the curtain\n  back, and the man in the mask is standing there, and he slams his hand\n  on the window. She screams in terror, and bumps into the phonograph in\n  the living room, knocking the needle off track, which causes it to\n  begin repeating the same phrase from a country song. Suddenly, the\n  front door opens slightly, and Kristen approaches it. In between the\n  crack of the door someone wearing a doll-like mask peeks her head\n  through. Kristen closes the door, locks it, and hides in the bedroom,\n  yelling for the strangers to go away. Suddenly, the vinyl album stops\n  skipping, and footsteps come down the hallfortunately, it is only\n  James, who is entirely unaware of what is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe couple search the house, but find nobody, and James initially\n  believes Kristen to be letting her imagination get to her. The couple\n  see the blonde woman, Dollface (Gemma Ward), standing in the back\n  yard, staring at the house. James then goes outside to the car to\n  retrieve his cell phone, only to find the car entirely vandalized, and\n  his cell phone stolen. Dollface touches the back of his neck as he is\n  crouched down in the car, and runs off, only to reappear a few feet\n  from the car. He tells her to leave, and Kristen pokes her head\n  outside in concern. James turns to Kristen, and when he turns back\n  around, Dollface has vanished. James returns to the house, and he and\n  Kristen find his cell phone sitting on the piano with its battery\n  removed. James decides it's time to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThey go outside and attempt to drive away in the car, even with its\n  tires slashed, but a truck pulls up behind them, driven by a different\n  unidentified woman, wearing a mask that resembles a pin up. The Man in\n  the Mask (Kip Weeks) appears in front of the car, and the Pin Up\n  Girl(Laura Margolis) rear-ends the car, as James and Kristen scramble\n  back into the house. They find a shotgun and gun shells in the\n  bedroom, along with the word \"hello\" written all over the bedroom\n  window in red paint by the villains. They approach the front door with\n  the gun, and the Man in the Mask begins to break through the door with\n  an axe. They block the door with the piano, and James attempts to\n  shoot him, but misses. They then hide in a room down the hallway,\n  armed with the gun toward the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eJames' friend, Mike (Glenn Howerton), whom he called earlier, arrives\n  at the house, and has a rock thrown through his windshield. He\n  approaches the house, and hears country music playing loudly on the\n  record player. He enters through the back glass door, just as Dollface\n  emerges from the shadows behind him. He sees the house is a complete\n  disaster, and he walks down the hallway as the music continues\n  playing. The Man in the Mask appears behind him, holding up his axe\n  preparing to strike. Just as the music stops, Mike steps in the\n  doorway, and James fires the gun, striking Mike right in the head. He\n  dies instantly, and after a few seconds James and Kristen realize they\n  shot the wrong person. The villains paint \"KILLER\" on the back door to\n  taunt James, and he heads to the barn outside to use a ham radio for\n  help. He spots Pin Up Girl emerging from the barn, and attempts to\n  shoot at her from down on the ground, but the Man in the Mask runs up\n  behind him at full speed. Kristen soon follows, after she senses the\n  presence of the Man in the Mask in the house. She falls, twists her\n  ankle, and is unknowingly stalked through the front lawn by Pin Up\n  Girl. Once she gets to the barn, she fiddles with the radio, but it is\n  then destroyed by Pin Up Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eKristen crawls back to the house, as Dollface sits on the swing set in\n  the backyard and Pin Up Girl stands in front of the barn.

He leaves, and just as Kristen is about to\n  slip out of the pantry, Dollface appears in the door's slit shutters,\n  and smashes it through. She then pauses, and notices the engagement\n  ring, and Kristen emerges from the pantry, while Dollface taunts her\n  by spinning a butcher knife around on the counter. The Man in the Mask\n  then enters the house, holding a defeated James by his shirt collar.\n  Kristen runs to the bedroom, but the window does not open. The lights\n  come back on, and she creeps back toward the hallway. Upon reaching\n  the doorway, The Man in the Mask rushes toward her, slamming her head\n  into the back wall of the hallway. She falls to the floor and he drags\n  her down the hall. She is initially unconscious but soon begins to\n  claw at the floor and the screen fades to black as she screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIt is then daylight, and each of the strangers loom over Kristen and\n  James, who are now tied to chairs in the living room; Kristen has been\n  dressed back into her white gown. Kristen cries, and asks \"Why are you\n  doing this to us?\", to which Dollface emotionlessly replies, \"Because\n  you were home\". Each villain removes their mask, but the camera does\n  not show their faces. The three strangers then take turns stabbing\n  James and Kristen, and then leave in their truck. As they drive down\n  the road, they stop to talk to two boys delivering religious\n  pamphlets. Dollface gets out of the truck and asks for one, to which\n  one of the boys asks, \"Are you a sinner?\". \"Sometimes\", she says, and\n  when the children are out of ear shot, Pin Up Girl says quietly,\n  \"It'll be easier next time.\" The strangers then drive off.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe two boys approach the house, and enter to find a bloody and\n  disastrous scene.

He was able to duplicate the Energy Bending which is possible to avatars only, using his bloodbending. My guess is that he does something to the blood flow (to the areas that correspond to bending) in brain, that probably \u003cem\u003edisables\u003c/em\u003e those parts of brain which are used to control bending. He must have got this knowledge about parts of brain and the energy flow in brain etc. because of his additional knowledge about chi-blocking. We should keep in mind that he is the only person who knows both chi-blocking and bloodbending. Amon must have used these both successfully to duplicate Energy Bending in this aspect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmon also doesn't heal/restore his brother's bending abilities at the end. He could have let his brother have at least the water bending abilities so that he could help him in his next quest. However, he doesn't/couldn't do that. Energy Benders can restore these abilities. It seems Bloodbenders like Amon can't do this sort of thing (not yet). This proves that Amon didn't have real Energy Bending abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAnd if so, how did bending Korra's energy take away all forms of bending except Air-Bending?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that there are \u003cem\u003eparts of brain\u003c/em\u003e corresponding to each bending ability. When Korra's abilities were removed, she didn't have the ability to air bend. Also, Amon knew what abilities she had/ didn't have. So, he must have probably removed the other three. Trying to unlock them might have led korra to unlock the one that hasn't been unlocked before, because she was in a situation where she needed to bend in order to save her love. So, she might have directed all her bending chi to the area which she never was able to direct to before. This could also hint that she was connecting to her spiritual self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if in case there was nothing like \u003cem\u003eparts of brain\u003c/em\u003e for each bending ability - it could mean two things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eA person could do other form of bending that is different from what\nhas been taken away. It means that a fire bender can learn water\nbending after their fire bending has been taken away. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is similar to alchemists learning Alkahestry in Full Metal Alchemist:  Brotherhood no matter whether they still have Alchemy abilities or not. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eKorra must have started connecting to her spiritual self even more\nstrongly and learned the air bending ability from Aang. It was said\nin the series that Aang connected to his previous lives and had this\nimmense experience behind him to ask from. Korra must have done\nthat, and got the air bending abilities from Aang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis would mean that her spiritual quest must have started when she\nwas in the metal container, and made her learn the air bending\nabilities in the process and finally led to her becoming a perfect\navatar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding what Amon did under the assumption that \u003cem\u003eparts of brain\u003c/em\u003e didn't exist, it would mean that Amon wasn't able to simulate the Energy Bending totally. We know that Energy benders have some special abilities among which removing/ restoring bending is a part. Amon should have been able to use his skill only in the removing aspect and not the restoring aspect. Even when he was a child, he says that removing is the best quality among all - this could mean that he must have concentrated on this single aspect and forgot/ disregarded the other ones. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also means that Amon was never interested in learning Energy Bending, but only the removing part of it, the only thing he was able to do successfully.

The Manipulated Dead will manipulate the Living Receiver\n  using the Fourth Dimensional Construct. The Manipulated Dead will\n  often set an Ensurance Trap for the Living Receiver to ensure that the\n  Artifact is returned safely to the Primary Universe.

This person, after\n  death, has the ability to travel back in time and guide the Living\n  Receiver to get the Artifact back to the Original Universe - the\n  Primary Universe. At some point in the future (in the Tangent\n  Universe), a character called Frank dies. We’ll get to who Frank is\n  and how he dies later on. Frank is now a Manipulated Dead and travels\n  back in time to meet Donnie. Frank begins guiding Donnie towards his\n  mission. Donnie’s mission is transporting the Jet Engine to the\n  Primary Universe before the Tangent Universe collapses. This mission\n  will ensure the Primary Universe doesn’t collapse too. Dead Frank,\n  along with the Living, constantly guide Donnie towards various\n  actions. Each of these actions form a trail culminating at the goal.\n  Does Donnie know what his mission is?

In this case, by travelling back in time, the traveller created an alternate history in which he existed as a time-traveler; therefore to maintain causal consistency, his alternate-history non-travelling self (who here was just born) MUST travel back in time to stabilize the alternate history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut as Bender explains, by winning the election, he prevents the catastrophe that motivated the search for the time code and the resulting time-travel, so he failed to stabilize the alternate history.  The original history - where Nixon wins unopposed - reasserts itself.  We even see the Planet Express crew - those most closely tied to the time-traveller - start to forget the traveller as their original history memories reassert themselves (though the fact that this does not happen immediately is interesting).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn't the traveller search for the time code while President, you ask (I know I just did)?  It is highly likely he simply wasn't aware that it was necessary.  So on the date when he was supposed to go back in time but didn't, from that moment the alternate history began to unwind backwards.  The unwinding just happened to hit the traveller just after the election when he was on the podium, which is why he started to dissolve just then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, we must also remember: Time-paradox duplicates are always doomed!\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Time travel paradox in Futurama","tags":["plot-explanation","futurama","time-travel"],"score":-1,"question_id":3093,"answer_id":52281},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eWell, the two standard ways of resolving time travel paradoxes are the consistent universe and the split timeline solutions. In the consistent universe solution the time traveller could not have managed to defeat Nixon in the first place, so that can be ruled out. Therefore the split timeline solution would apply. In the many worlds solution, by travelling back in time, he created a new branch of the time line, in which he arrives in the past, defeats Nixon, but doesn't travel back. The time line where he doesn't arrive in the past, but travels back exists \"parallel\" to the other one. Therefore in the split timeline resolution, there would be two timelines, one where Nixon won, and one where he didn't.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince the two timelines in some sense form a common causal loop (although saying Nixon won \u003cem\u003ebecause\u003c/em\u003e the man didn't travel back is a bit of a stretch), one sees the story line following one full iteration of that loop (which involves \u003cem\u003etwo\u003c/em\u003e times jumping back to the past; once with the time traveller, and once where there is no time travelling). Of course a loop (even if it is a double loop) doesn't have a natural end (i.e. as you correctly noticed, after Nixon winning, you could have followed the time traveller travelling back in time and defeating Nixon again), after having shown the full loop once, there's nothing new (you'd just see a repeat of the exact same events you've seen previously).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course if you want a more \"realistic\" view of the causal loop, nobody hinders you from watching the episode repeatedly in an endless loop. :-)\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Time travel paradox in Futurama","tags":["plot-explanation","futurama","time-travel"],"score":6,"question_id":3093,"answer_id":3105}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8223}

And also knowing that his last memory (of his wife) will corroborate the idea that she was murdered that night, which will validate his quest for vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo he deliberately (and successfully) manipulates himself (and kills some innocent drug dealer who was set up by Teddy to make money in the process), simply because he knows that a normal life is no longer possible for him (due to his condition as well as the death of his wife) and that he needs a simple goal (vengeance) to keep going forward, day after day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(We can only speculate that once he killed the cop, he will repeat the process with some other random clues, in order to give his life some meaning again. ;) )\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What really happened in Memento?","tags":["plot-explanation","memento"],"score":33,"question_id":3234,"answer_id":3256},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eI think you have the events correct.

As a reader we can assume that they had their intellectual duel in these 2 years. The creators already put a thorough illustration of this duel in the first 2 seasons. if you look at the list there are still plenty of notable adventures which remains after Moriarty's death such as the Empty House, World War stories etc. (An ardent reader might argue that the best of the stories happened only either before or during the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Sherlock_Holmes\"\u003eMemoirs of Sherlock Holmes\u003c/a\u003e, that's a different topic altogether)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTHe creators only made 2/4 Long stories (A Study in Pink and Hound of Baskervilles) so far in the series and from Moriarty's death we can safely assume that Valley of Fear won't be adapted which still leaves room for \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four\"\u003eThe Sign of Four\u003c/a\u003e (A significant story where Watson meets Mary Morstan who becomes his wife) and if you read Moffat's comments \u003ca href=\"http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/sherlock-creator-moriarty-wont-return/261748\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e we can safely assume that creators want to focus on other villains created by Doyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEither that or the creators are playing coy and bring Moriarty back alive to settle the Final duel once and for all.

Where?!” Fox says, cowering with eyes wide open.  The Wolf is\n  described as the wildest, most frightening, and yet most beautiful\n  creature in the world.

Anderson has\n  spoken often of his fondness for “self-contained worlds,” a penchant\n  he says comes from Peanuts—and while all of Anderson’s worlds feel\n  self-contained, that’s never more true than here, in which all the\n  action literally takes place on a (fictional) island. The magic of\n  self-contained worlds is also one of the central themes of the film:\n  At the end of the movie we learn that Moonrise Kingdom takes its name\n  from Sam and Suzy’s own secret place, a cove where they try to make a\n  life of their own away from troubles back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIt’s there that Moonrise’s hero bonds with his own Little Red-Haired\n  Girl: Suzy.

For personal reasons, Lucy Ball wanted to produce the programme from Hollywood instead of New York City, but New York was the only place where live TV was produced and broadcast live.

This started a trend. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTueth says they also insisted on filming with a live audience, but this wasn't repeated until a new wave of comedies in the 1970s, such as \u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e (1971 – 1979) started announcing it \"was filmed in front of a live studio audience\". \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_the_family#Production\"\u003eWikipedia\u003c/a\u003e says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e was the first major American series to be videotaped in front of a live studio audience. In the 1960s, most sitcoms had been filmed in the single-camera format without audiences, with a laugh track simulating audience response. Lear employed the Multi-camera format of shooting in front of an audience, but used tape, whereas previous multi-camera shows like \u003cem\u003eMary Tyler Moore\u003c/em\u003e had used film. Thanks to the success of \u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e, videotaping sitcoms in front of an audience became common format for the genre during the 1970s. The use of videotape also gave \u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e the look and feel of early live television, including the original live broadcasts of \u003cem\u003eThe Honeymooners\u003c/em\u003e, to which \u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e is sometimes compared.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eFor the show's final season, the practice of being taped before a live audience changed to playing the already taped and edited show to an audience and recording their laughter to add to the original sound track. Thus, the voice-over during the end credits was changed from Rob Reiner's \"\u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e was recorded on tape before a live audience\" to Carroll O'Connor's \"\u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e was played to a studio audience for live responses\".

Videotaped live, Lear wanted the studio audience to actually like the performer, with hopes of the two developing a rapport with each other. Lear was not a fan of pretaped audiences, resulting in no laugh track being employed, not even during post-production when Lear could have had the luxury of sweetening any failed jokes (Lear relented somewhat in later seasons, and allowed [sound engineer and laugh track inventer Charles] Douglass to insert an occasional laugh). Lear's decision resulted in the show being a huge success, and officially ushered in the return of live audiences to the U.S. sitcom mainstream.

Like the guards; who in the begging of every scene involved, watch Teddy with fear until Teddy faces their direction, then they look away. The guards, the policemen and his “partner” does this constantly, in situations that do not make sense. The argument can be made that Teddy is a crazy patient and they were fearful of his violence..yet other events don’t add up with that perception. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, in one scene Teddy climbs down the cliff to get to the lighthouse. There was a cigarette he picked up, and a body at the shoreline which really wasn't there. The lighthouse was supposedly where Nazis did surgeries on the human brain, manipulating their thoughts and emotions..weird how in this scene, when Teddy reaches the bottom of the cliff rats come out- from what looks like man made tunnels in the rocks.

Somehow made it so they can make him see whatever they wanted him to see at any time, regardless of where it is. It could be physical technology, occult channeling, hypnotism who knows.

The video recording that was activated by playing the piano had Quaid stating that he was Cohagen's agent with the mission of getting close to and killing the rebel leader. He said that this mission changed when he met Melina, and she showed him the \"truth\" about the rebels. So, we are lead to believe that Cohagen realized Quaid had turned, so he gave Quaid the false information about the kill code as an unknown source of disinformation. Then, to make the disinformation seem real, Cohagen captured, brainwashed, and hid Quaid from the rebels. By doing this and having the \"wife\" complicate things, he made it seem that the info Quaid found out was very important. Once the rebels got the \"average Joe\" Quaid to the rebel leader, they tried to access the information about the kill code in his brain. But, this just allowed Cohagen to trace the location of the rebels, since the code doesn't exist. In the 2012 version, it seems that Cohagen played Quaid from day one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, for the 2012 version, the purpose Quaid served as a factory worker was to be a \"trojan horse\" and unknowing double agent after he was brainwashed.

From there, Quaid needed to find his way back to the resistance, but there needed to be an active perception that Cohagen didn't want him getting back to the resistance, thus the \"wife\" who's trying to stop him.

It originated in the 15th century and\n  meant \"to cheep, as a young bird,\" according to the Oxford English\n  Dictionary (OED). The more well-known meaning, to emit a high-pitched\n  bark, came about around 1907, as per the OED, and gained the\n  figurative meaning \"to shout; to complain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eYip is imitative in origin but probably also influenced by the 16th\n  century yelp, which has an even older meaning of \"boasting,\n  vainglorious speaking.\" Yawp is even older, coming about in the 14th\n  century, but now is primarily associated with Walt Whitman's late 19th\n  century \"barbaric yawp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe yips are \"nervousness or tension that causes an athlete to fail to\n  perform effectively, especially in missing short putts in golf.\" As we\n  mentioned in a Word Soup column back in November, some sources,\n  including the OED, cite the first known use of the yips as 1962.\n  However, we found a citation from 1941: \"The match consumed three\n  hours and thirty minutes, most of it because Cobb, the tingling-nerved\n  old baseball Tiger, got the 'yips' on many greens and would step back\n  and line up his putts several times per putt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eYippee came about after yip. The earliest record of this exclamation\n  of delight is from 1920 in Sinclair Lewis's novel, Main Street: \"She\n  galloped down a block and as she jumped from a curb across a welter of\n  slush, she gave a student 'Yippee!'\" Yippee beans, by the way, are\n  amphetamines.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eYippie with an -ie refers to \"a member of a group of politically\n  radical hippies, active especially during the late 1960s.\" The word,\n  which originated in 1968, stands for Youth International Party and was\n  modeled after hippie.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eNow how about the whole phrase, yippee-ki-yay? It seems to be a play\n  on \"yippie yi yo kayah,\" a refrain from a 1930s Bing Crosby song, \"I'm\n  An Old Cowhand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eDo cowboys really say this?

A skit refers to this trope as a \"mool-gwishin 물귀신\" (that's the Korean written language), which some googling got to a few separate descriptions that mention the long haired, white robed ghost.  Wikipedia's article on \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwishin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGwishin (귀신)\u003c/a\u003e states:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eGwishin are usually transparent, legless and float in mid-air. Old gwishin usually have white \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbok\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHanbok\u003c/a\u003e (한복) which are worn for funerals. They have long, drooping black hair and sometimes they are faceless, depending on their personality. Male gwishin are somewhat rare, but they're like female ghosts, except female gwishin are more often heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Korea has similar ghost legends that match the Onryo's description.  The summary for the gwishin (귀신) article provides some background detail on them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eGwishin (귀신) are Korean ghosts who are similar to a Yogwi (요괴); they are people who have died, not monsters or creatures such as Dokkaebi. They can be found in many places, but are commonly in abandoned buildings, houses, cemeteries, forests, etc. When a person who dies without completing something that they must do (e.g. revenge or staying longer with their family), their spirit remains on earth to complete the task before going on to the underworld. However, very strong gwishin do not go to the underground world if they want to remain on earth, and over time these gain strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, one of the reasons gwishin (귀신) are around is to seek revenge, another similarity with the Onryo.  This looks like Korea has similar legends as Japan, which helps confirm this is an Asian ghost legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Cultural Basis of Asian Ghost Lady","tags":["horror","japanese-cinema"],"score":15,"question_id":3981,"answer_id":3982}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7333}

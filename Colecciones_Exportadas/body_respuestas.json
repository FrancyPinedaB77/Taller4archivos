The main character, though, was an Indiana Jones-type mouse named Kit Colby who sported a fedora and a fluffy collared World War II bomber pilot jacket. When he proposed the show in a meeting with Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the idea was well-received...except for the character of Kit Colby.

If you have an amazing Columbia costume or what have you, you might get some compliments, but if you're just dressed normally, you'll almost certainly be in the majority. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yTGee.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yTGee.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0h7Tn.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0h7Tn.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qRfwv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qRfwv.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, these photos of audiences at RHPS screenings are a reasonable reflection of what I've seen in the theaters I've been to.  A small number of fans in full Transylvanian regalia (usually sitting in the front rows), one or two folks in costumes with no apparent connection to RHPS, and a large majority wearing normal street clothes.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eNot engaging in call-backs (i.e., shouting at the screen):\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNone of the things I've covered in this answer so far are big deals, but this one is the least big deal of all.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor starters, you're going to be in a dark movie theater, with a loud movie playing, and most of the audience will be screaming for most of the movie;  their visual attention will be focused on the screen and the shadowcast below the screen.  As such, it will be difficult for anyone to even \u003cem\u003enotice\u003c/em\u003e that you're not shouting along with them.  Just like every other time people go to a movie, they're watching the movie, not staring at the other people in the theater.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, everyone was a RHPS virgin once.  If you've never been to a screening, you don't know what to shout or when to shout it.  You probably won't get a good grasp of the call-backs until your third or fourth visit.  So there will \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e be at least a few people in the crowd who are just taking it all in, not participating in the madness.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eShadowcasts:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a total non-issue.  The shadowcast is determined long before the night of the screening, and at most theaters, there is a set group of people who serve as the shadowcast on a revolving basis.  I've never seen the cast ask for volunteers at a screening.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDancing the \u003cem\u003eTime Warp\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the one aspect of audience participation that, if you choose to abstain from, you might catch some flack.  At my first screening, I was a shy 12-year-old who was embarrassed to dance in front of strangers.  The people around me realized this and encouraged me, and I quickly joined in - to much applause and cheering from the people near me.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother time, I brought a date to RHPS.  She had no idea what the movie was, or what would happen in the theater, and she refused to participate in any way.  No one noticed that she was wearing regular clothes, not doing call-backs, not using props, etc, but when the \u003cem\u003eTime Warp\u003c/em\u003e began, the people around us \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e react, and more than one person said stuff like \"Get up and dance, dammit!\", etc.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, nothing will happen to you if you refuse to dance, but it \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e attract some attention from your immediate neighbors, and even a comment or two.  Aside from these two instances, I've never noticed anyone \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e dancing the \u003cem\u003eTime Warp\u003c/em\u003e;  if you're shy or embarrassed to join in, no one will force you to do so, but you should try to remember that \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e is doing it, and you won't look any sillier than they do.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think the reason people are more likely to comment when people don't dance, while they don't even notice when people don't do call-backs or use props, is because an RHPS Virgin has no way of knowing the call-backs or which props to use, but everyone knows how to do the \u003cem\u003eTime Warp\u003c/em\u003e the first time around.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow do Virgins know how to do the \u003cem\u003eTime Warp\u003c/em\u003e, you ask?

In fact, many of these local screenings will sell prop bags (or even include them in the price of admission) so that everyone who wants to can play along. This is also a great way of restricting which props are brought in as some theaters ban certain props.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, even people who are regulars will often go in \"plain clothes\".

Of course, being surrounded by 10-15 of your friends is also a good thing. You should dress in whatever makes YOU feel comfortable, but also does not violate any local standards (this usually means nudity is out.) Speaking of violating laws and norms of society, it is usually best to go to RHPS sober the first time. Not only will you be more in-tune to pick up all the clever things going on around you, some theaters will not admit those people who look drunk - what theater manager wants to clean up after a drunk at 2:30 a.m.?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eBut hey, what about the props and audience participation lines and dressing up in costume? Well, no one expects you to know much of anything your first time out. While audience participation is mandatory to keep the show alive, it is not mandatory that everyone participate, every time. Virgins are not expected to know a damn thing (just like in sex.)\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIf you really want to bring props, check with your local theater and ask what props are not allowed. The safest ones to bring are rice (banned at some, but not most theaters), toast (unbuttered), toilet paper and a deck of cards. A newspaper may help keep you from getting wet, but water is banned at many theaters. Watch everyone else to figure out when to throw these items.

They are basically men's fantasies (and we know true dudes don't bind themselves to a single woman ;-)). And even if this has loosened a little during later years, be that with Bond girls that turn out to be the villains behind everything (e.g. \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143145/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe World is Not Enough\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), or super spies who are female equals to him (e.g. \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120347/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTomorrow Never Dies\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDie Another Day\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), or women he doesn't actually have sex with (e.g. \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eQuantum of Solace\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), it is still \u003cstrong\u003eone of the most characteristic aspects of this character and the whole series\u003c/strong\u003e.

In reality, what you see on film (unless there are no cuts at all) is a compilation of potentially dozens of takes of on-set film and audio recording, possibly coupled with digital recording sessions done after the fact (the way they record audio for animated films).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eShooting a scene\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn a \u003cem\u003esingle camera\u003c/em\u003e shoot, for dialogue-centric scenes you are correct. \u003cstrong\u003eGenerally\u003c/strong\u003e, the director and cinematographer will set up the camera for one shot and all or part of the scene will be recorded both with video and audio and they will likely run through the scene anywhere from 3-100 times depending on the director. Audio is carefully recorded for both (or all) characters, not only the one on camera at the time. This is generally done with a combination of lavaliere microphones (body mics) and a boom pole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the director is happy with one or more of the takes, the camera will be repositioned for another setup and the process will repeat. This will be repeated until the entire scene is completed and may be anything from one shot to five or more depending on the number of people in the scene and how complex it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn a \u003cem\u003emulti-camera\u003c/em\u003e shoot (more common with TV), it's often possible to record two or more shots at the same time, though this can reduce the quality of the frame you are able to get as you have to \"shoot around\" the other camera/s. This is, however, a great way to get your dialogue to match perfectly, provided the audio is good and both actors do good performances in the same take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for order of shooting, generally directors tend to start wide and move in from there.  The beginning of the scene will often be recorded in a wide shot to set up the location and as the conversation intensifies, will generally get closer to the people. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the scene at the counter in the cafe, possible shot frames include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWide - both people sitting at the counter from either side of the counter with the rest of the cafe in view behind them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTwo-shot - closer-in version of the above, but with focus more directly on both actors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClose up - shot of only one character. May be \"dirtied\" by the shoulder or the head of the other person closer to the camera.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtreme close up - shot of something small... a hand playing with a cup on the counter, the eyes of one of the characters.

There's even a crew member whose entire job is to help reduce these issues and actors are trained to do their best to precisely repeat their actions in a way that makes them less likely... unfortunately, this isn't always possible. Editors work to minimize the errors that end up in the finished product but if there are only a few takes that are considered good enough to use, you're stuck with the errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSound Editing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen sound is edited, what dialogue track is used depends on several factors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equality of the on-set sound recording\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eperformance quality\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edialogue changes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the quality of the on-set sound recording is poor - this is usually due to being in a noisy location or having low-quality equipment - it may be necessary to do studio recording of audio after the fact. This may also be necessary if it's decided that the dialogue needs to be changed. Recording in a studio gets very good audio but it can be challenging to line up the new recording with the recording of the video - most often made challenging when changing dialogue or due to not having the same emotion as when on set. Actors get a lot of emotional queues from the each other and from the set and the director. When in a sound booth, it can feel somewhat stale so it can be difficult for them to put themselves in the same frame of mind they were in when originally filming the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of the dialogue not matching up with the secondary person in frame, this isn't particularly uncommon - if the delivery of a line was much better in another take and the character is mostly off-screen or if the editor plans to switch between shots in the middle of a line, it's considered a minor issue for their lip movements to not match perfectly. Yes, you want to do your best, as with the continuity issue mentioned above, but it's not always possible and (in general) the average viewer won't notice it unless it's really bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\"Rules\" of Editing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first warnings they gave me when I started taking editing classes was \"be prepared to notice annoying stuff that never bothered you before\"... continuity issues and lip synch are things that editors are trained to look for so they become very obvious to them.

In the s2e21 The Runaway Dinosaur, it is revealed more explicitly that Barry is still grieving over the death of his mother and how much he misses her. Barry also more recently is grieving over the very recent loss of his father Henry Allen in the episode Invincible(2.22). Zoom killed him as a way to convince Barry that they were alike, and his father essentially died as a means of making a point. It is here that Barry's emotional state falters, and his plan changes from stopping zoom to killing zoom. (Turning Barry into a killer is exactly what zoom wanted) His closest friends see this and therefore conspire behind his back to defeat zoom without him. This betrayal sticks in Barry's mind, and he is an outsider among all but Wally, and feels killing zoom is the only way to stop him from continuing to terrorize other earths. The final straw though isn't just his father's death, but the revelation that the real Jay Gerrik which zoom had kept locked in a cell for months (?) Is his dads doppelganger. Barry is so heartbroken, especially since it's only been days (?) since the loss of his father, that he has to leave the room to cry in the hallway. Everything is too much for him, and this revelations shows how even after zoom is defeated, somehow the universe is still finding ways to make him suffer. When he defeats zoom by creating a time remnant of himself, it further reinforces how Barry will do anything, including sacrifice himself, for those he loves. This is also seen when Barry gives up his powers to zoom in order to save Wally (the son Joe should have had if it weren't for Barry becoming an orphan). Barry gave up his powers for him who he knew least, and did it because of how much Joe cared for him. Barry is willing to give up his powers and his life for those he loves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the episode Barry decides to go back in time to stop Eobard from killing his mother because in his mind, being the flash has caused more harm than good to those closest to him. Being the flash led to the death of his mother as well as the wrongful imprisonment of his father for years, and then his death. Barry feels immensely responsible and guilty for the death of earth 2's Joe West (2.13. Welcome to Earth 2). Eddies death in the season 1 finale we know he feels guilty about when he returns from Earth 2 with a special video message from Eddie to iris). Even the particle accelerator explosion was intentionally made to create the flash and led to the creation of meta human villains. Barry being the flash has caused all this damage, and his father's death (and Jay Gerrik being his father's doppelganger) is the final straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis episode ends with zoom being defeated, and yes everything appears, as we watch Barry gaze longingly into the house, okay. He even gets to be with Iris, sharing their first genuine kiss, which is everything he's always wanted. But as he looks back into the house, taking everything written above and seen in the show into consideration, Barry is not happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis closest friends get to come home to their families at the end of the day, but Barry, despite having a new growing family with everyone, is an outsider who doesn't have any real family to call his own. He is alone and sad and thinks that the only way to stop himself from the extreme loss he's felt as a result of being the flash is to go back in time and save his mother. This act is a selfish one. Barry knows that saving his mother will mean he will no longer be the flash, but as we know from previous experiences, Barry is willing to give up his powers for someone he barely knows, so giving them up for his mother's life isn't hard at all for him. Barry gives up a life with Iris and Joe everything else to change the past because all the pain and sadness and anger he's built up over the last 2 years of being the flash is too much for him, and saving his parents is the only thing that can give him true happiness and fulfillment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for what he expects to happen, I think Barry thinks that by not becoming the flash, he will be able to live a peaceful normal life with both his parents, and that perhaps another person will take up the title of the flash, or no one will. But, as you stated, Barry's time traveling adventures haven't all been successful, so changing this significant moment might not lead to the ideal life that he wishes he could have. But he decides to do it anyway, because the idea of having both his parents with him is more desirable than the life he's made for himself as the flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the show, it is highly likely they will be following the flashpoint paradox storyline, in which similarly, (spoiler) Barry after still grieving his mother's loss, goes back in time to save her, and therefore creates an alternative dystopian reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why does Barry do what he does at the end of Flash Season 2?","tags":["plot-explanation","arrowverse","the-flash"],"score":3,"question_id":55514,"answer_id":55520}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9485,"entidades":1.0}

Sweeney or 'sweeny' [sic],\n  although referring literally to atrophy in the shoulder-muscles of a\n  horse, was also more commonly and figuratively used to connote 'the\n  stiffness of \"pride\" or self-conceit' (OED). Alternatively, Sweeney's\n  name may have recalled for some readers the Irish name and figure of\n  the mad king 'Sweeney' of the Buile Suibhne of Celtic legend. Louis\n  James, in his Fiction for the Working Man (Oxford, 1963), first noted\n  with reference to the story's original title that an interesting\n  process of association of ideas is suggested by the fact that the\n  London Directories record an \"S. Todd, pearl-stringer\", who lived at\n  Clerkenwell at this time' (191). Finally, the name may simply be an\n  unconsciously reversed recollection and slightly jumbled\n  reformulation, in its assonance, of the character of 'Poll\n  Sweedlepipe' in Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit (see Introduction, xvii).\n  Sweedlepipe, whose services as 'an easy shaver ... and a fashionable\n  hairdresser, also' were advertised to his clients in his shop-window\n  at Kingsgate Street, High Holborn, would still have been fresh in the\n  public's imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(*Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, US \u0026amp; Canada Edition)\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How did Benjamin Barker come up with the titular name Sweeney Todd?","tags":["plot-explanation","sweeney-todd"],"score":1,"question_id":56487,"answer_id":61153}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8512,"entidades":1.0}

Pulling up the collar to hide his face, he then proceeded to furtively move around the house, tapping on windows and rattling doorknobs.

He walks away from his past world of impurity and goes to Himalayas and becomes an Aghori or Sadhu. He meditates for years and gets 'Gnyaanodhaya' or 'Enlightenment' and transforms into a New person called 'Neenu', who is completely contrast to his past identity. In a way he has taken a rebirth. He comes back to his Village and starts living with his parents and family whom he had abandoned during his childhood. He doesn't want anything to himself, he only works for and helps others, which gives him happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e2) A millionaire German business tycoon Richards marries an Indian woman Mandaakini. Saleem will be their personal assistant. Richards dies in an accident and Saleem takes over all of Richards wealth and property.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e3) Mandaakini runs from Saleem who wants to get the ownership of all the property which belongs to her. She leaves after writing a 'Will' stating that if a person called 'Neenu' who 'does not think' marries her daughter 'Kushi' then all property goes to him. She has secretly raised her daughter somewhere far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e4) The will comes into the possession of the Police Department \u0026amp; then passed on to the Central Investigation Department \u0026amp; everyone including the CID officers and the Police Department led by Shinde have their eyes on the will. The word even spreads to Saleem who is now a Don in Dubai.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e5) A girl called Lakshmi (Kristina) comes looking for Neenu in his village, as she is curious about his personality after hearing about him from her Psychology professor. Also Saleem sends his assistant Malpe Baala (LK Bala ;) ) and his goons to search Neenu. Also the Police (Shinde, and 2 constables) \u0026amp; another rowdy (Boda) are also behind Neenu. All of them are behind Neenu because his name is in the Will and they want to catch him / kill him so that they can get hold of all the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e6) Saleem \u0026amp; Baala dont know that Lakshmi herself is Kushi, who has been secretly raised by her mother. They dont know that this is the same girl who is mentioned in the will along with Neenu. Lakshmi comes searching for Neenu in his village and falls for him. The police try to arrest Neenu but they are stopped by a phone call from a 'higher influence'. This phone call is made by some higher officials by Mandaakini's influence, who is also watching over Neenu, her potential son in law.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e7) The dons and goons see Lakshmi flirting with Neenu. Now what they want is, somehow if they make Neenu to marry this girl Lakshmi, then the rule of the Will can be broken i.e. Neenu wont marry Kushi so he wont get the property. So they call Lakshmi to the boat and tell her get engaged with Neenu and marry him somehow which she readily agrees since she also wants the same as she loves him. They give her a bunglow which is in their control and tell her to act like it is hers so that Neenu family comes in desire for wealth and force him to marry her.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e8 ) Meanwhile the police officer Shinde investigates the past life of this Neenu and finds out from an Aghori in Himalaya that Neenu once used to live there as a Sadhu after leaving behind his past life of Naanu. Shinde wants the money for himself and does not want Saleem to succeed in his plan, so he makes Lakshmi's friend Sheela (Parul) to tell her a false story about Neenu that he cheated her and tried to kill her. All the flashback story with Parul in Himalayas are all cooked up stories forcibly made to be told by the Police.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e9) Saleem's ships carrying cocaine are blasted. LK Baala thinks that 'Naanu' whom he had encountered in the Past (in Upendra movie) attacked his ships. Baala \u0026amp; the CID officers (who are also behind the property) get an Unknown call from a person to come to a location where he has hidden Kushi (which is a trap for Saleem, Baala \u0026amp; the gangsters). Lakshmi gets an Unknwon call from the same person to come to a bunglow. This person who gave unknown calls is revealed to be Neenu.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e10) Naanu is just an illusion of LK Baala as he is constantly haunted by his Past and his brain always keeps thinking about Past. That is why he is attacked by Past Upendra i.e. Naanu and ends up in a hospital. The CID officers who are also behind money, have brains which think only about Future, so they imagine or predict that a secret agent aka Unknown (who they think is Neenu) fighting off Saleem's goons and capturing Saleem. It is left to the audience to interpret what happens to Saleem, whether the CID officers themselves catch or kill Saleem in the ensuing gunfire, since the Future is 'Unknown'. Past is 'Illusion' and Future is 'Unknown' is the message of this Baala-Naanu-CID-Saleem-Unknown fight scene in the climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e11) The secret is Lakshmi's other name will be Kushi (kept as secret by her mother). It was Neenu's plan to give unknown calls to the gangsters \u0026amp; CID officers to come to the location so they can fight with themselves while he can safely meet or get Kushi ;) In the end Upendra aka Neenu asks her \"ivaag neen kushi thaane (Are you Kushi / Happy now ? for which she says yes) that means the Will is now satisfied. Neenu marries Kushi and will get all the property but he will not use it for himself he will continue to do service for others using all the wealth he has. LK Baala is stuck in the Past and haunted by Naanu and CID officers are still predicting the Future. Only Neenu \u0026amp; Kushi are living in present, which is the ideal way of living life is what the message in this film.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e12) Lakshmi (Money) is only Kushi (Happiness) and Kushi (Happiness) is only Lakshmi (Money) means if we are content with whatever amount of wealth or money or Lakshmi we have then automatically Kushi (happiness) will come.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e13) The climax - :D Since the Police Officer (Shinde) thinks that Lakshmi (money) \u0026amp; Kushi (Happiness) are two different women or entities, he is not able to find either of them in the end ;) Since 'Neenu' (us - the audience) already got Kushi (happiness), he asks us (the audience) in the end facing towards the camera saying where is Kushi, then we are shown the white screen - this white screen is nothing but a representation of the audience - or Neenu ;) This white screen is already shown in the beginning of the movie and the movie again ends with it - representing the 'Kaala Chakra' or the Cycle of Time.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003chr\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eSome assumptions and interpretations to support this version :\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e1) In this version we should interpret or assume that it is Manaadkini who is protecting Neenu from getting arrested by the police. it is also Mandaakini's men who kill the blackmailer of Neenu's sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e2) The future or Unknown or the special agent Upendra whom we have although assumed as only an imagination, can in reality actually be existing, the person who first saved Mandaakini from Saleem's men and discovered her 'Will' which he handed over to the department, but he may not necessarily be looking exactly like Neenu, it is only the CID officers who imagine him that he looks like (or is) Neenu.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e3) Also, it is he who blasted Saleem's Ships. Since the future is not set, it may be possible that he even eventually catches Saleem as imagined by the CID officers. In any case Saleem will either die or get caught :p\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e4) we can also interpret that it is this special agent who gave the unknown calls to gangsters and CID to come to the climax location and he gave unknown call to Kristina to go and meet Neenu in the bunglow. He is helping Kristina or Kushi to meet her soulmate as per the will written by her mother which he read in Mandaakini's house.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e5) It can also be he who made the phone call to stop the police from arresting Neenu, and it can be he who got blackmailer of Neenu's sister killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"What happens at the end of Uppi 2?","tags":["analysis","ending","uppi-2"],"score":1,"question_id":57062,"answer_id":57667}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7937,"entidades":1.0}

Background noise recorded during the actual shoot might come out sounding a little off in the recording, or just not be as loud or distinct as if you were actually in the room, especially if the actor creating the noise is farther away from the mic.

(In my experience, people will generally try to re-shoot the scene whenever possible in that scenario, but sometimes that just isn't feasible, so you end up dubbing.) Or you may need to do partial dubbing because of language issues, as Fellini famously had to do for \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Strada\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLa Strada.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e But I digress - you were mostly asking about sound effects, rather than actors' voices, I believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, the actual place/environment where a scene is shot may differ in some ways from the environment where the scene is supposed to take place.

Yes, you might be just fine \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e putting the word in italics, but putting it in italics can affect the tone in a way that it wouldn't otherwise. Similarly, making certain sounds louder/more audible (and for longer) than they would be in real life brings focus to those sounds, and can change the tone of a scene to something more suspenseful, scary, frustrating - whatever tone the scene is going for. The short film \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh7sQ4hPnyk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"The Last Farm\"\u003c/a\u003e is a good example of making certain sounds louder in order to emphasize/draw attention to them.

Furthermore, Pegg's proposal seems to be based on a misconception--he thought Sulu was born before 2233 when Nero arrived and the Kelvin incident occurred, but actually the best available info suggests Sulu was born after 2233 (probably in 2237), and Pegg probably got this idea from some badly-sourced info in an older edit of Sulu's wikipedia article, see my comment \u003ca href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/4uds40/a_deeper_dive_into_the_beyond_backstory_or/d5pmuj2\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e for details.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How does the USS Franklin fit in the pre-Kelvin Timeline?","tags":["star-trek","continuity","star-trek-beyond","star-trek-enterprise"],"score":6,"question_id":57164,"answer_id":57304},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThree options:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Franklin \u003csub\u003e(out of universe, named after the director's father, Frank Lin)\u003c/sub\u003e is the first Warp 4 ship. Essentially a precursor to the NX-class. Aesthetics aside, it does at least share the same general design and looks purposefully retro. It makes sense that during the war, it was refitted with at least newer weapons (still only spatial torpedoes, but does have the newer pulsed phase cannons which were first equipped on the NX-02). Upon re-commission as a UFP Starfleet ship, it was likely decided that the NX prefix would be used to denote a prototype, and the Franklin was apparently the first of it's class and given that designation. For all we know it could have originally been Franklin NW-01. Then when the UFP comes around the ships from the UESPA, Earth Starfleet, UESN, and other member races get re-registered as Federation Starfleet ships, and by the time they get to the Franklin, it's NX-326. It gets re-launched as an explorer and gets stranded. Pretty easy to work it in there. And this makes more sense than the next theory because this wouldn't conflict with the fact that there was a model of the NX-01 in Admiral Marcus's office... \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond Writer Simon Pegg mentioned Nero's incursion could have rippled farther back on that alternate timeline. \u003ca href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/simon-pegg-has-a-canonical-explanation-for-why-sulu-is-1783511576\"\u003ehttp://io9.gizmodo.com/simon-pegg-has-a-canonical-explanation-for-why-sulu-is-1783511576\u003c/a\u003e Which makes some sense given that there was such a vast difference in time between the Narada going through and the Jellyfish. Problem with this is, if that were the case and there was some extreme time dilation, then given the size of the Narada, it would have existed for quite some time as it merely passed through the temporal rift. This would mean it would have appeared longer ago and would have appeared to move very slowly. It would have been known for a lot longer and wouldn't have been a sudden phenomenon. So if it's not that time dilation effect, then it would have to be some \u003cstrong\u003e'retroactive continuity ripple effect'\u003c/strong\u003e backwards through time. There's no way to tell how that might affect things, but apparently it could cause enough of a change that the warp program was set back and instead of a warp 5 ship, Starfleet ended up with a warp 4 ship, which was smaller and aesthetically different but retained the same general configuration as the NX-class, like maybe a competing design won out. \u003cem\u003eHowever I believe this is a much poorer excuse and doesn't really resolve things as well.

But since, you've given a very long and detailed description, overcome by curiosity, I googled for the movie title. After some long browsing, I realized that what you are describing is not a movie at all, but a video game. This plot you've mentioned is exactly similar to the plot of the 1998 game \u003cstrong\u003eBattlezone\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1998_video_game)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e is a link to the wikipedia page of the game from where you could read the entire plot of the game.

Both sides have used scraps of extraterrestrial \"bio-metal\", which have fallen to Earth as meteors, to build vehicles with amazing properties such as hover capability. Both nations deploy into space and are fighting across the solar system to control other deposits of the bio-metal. Gameplay is divided up into two campaigns; one following the American National Space Defense Force (NSDF), the other with the Soviet Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA, also referred to as the Communist Cosmonaut Army in early game manuals).\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe American campaign starts on the Moon, but the NSDF is forced off after the destruction of their main base. They relocate to Mars, but find the Soviets already there. Both sides locate alien artifacts, and the Americans also find a factory; the long-dead alien race that created the bio-metal is identified as the Cthonians, who inhabited the planet Icarus (now the asteroid belt) and visited Earth on several occasions, influencing Greek mythology. The Americans learn of an ultimate weapon called the \"Fury\" and head to Venus to learn more about it. Another Cthonian relic is recovered, pointing to Jupiter's moon Io. The NSDF finds a third relic, but this is stolen by a scientist defecting to the Soviets. The player must steal a Soviet fighter craft and tap into the communications network, which reveals the CCA relocation to their main base on Saturn's moon Titan. The Americans clear nearby Europa of CCA units to prevent early warning to those on Titan, but the main assault is annihilated, as the Soviets have begun to manufacture Fury vehicles. However, the Furies turn on the Soviets; they are self-aware and programmed to destroy all life. Icarus was destroyed by the Cthonians to prevent the Furies from reaching Earth. The NSDF and CCA ally against the new threat, and after destroying the production factory on Titan, travel to the fictional moon of Achilles, orbiting Uranus. The Americans destroy the main Fury base, but this causes the moon's core to destabilise, and the player must destroy the Furies' evacuation vessel before it escapes, then escape themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can read the rest of the plot from the wikipedia page to which I gave the link above. The plot, including the names of the moons and races is just as you described. The only difference I noted was that the name of the ultimate weapon is changed to \u003ccode\u003eFury\u003c/code\u003e in the game whereas you mentioned it to be \u003ccode\u003eChimera\u003c/code\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's amazing that you could remember such a vivid amount of details, including the names of races and weapons and yet not recall it to be a game. Could it be that you read the description from somewhere or watched someone play the game and you later remembering only the content, led to believe that it was a movie? Now, I'm sorry if there is a movie with the same plot, made from the game or vice versa, but I however was not able to find any after an extensive google search.

In the Christian faith, all types of super natural act are considered acts of the devil (miracles performed by Jesus notwithstanding.)  Witch doctors, shamans, fortune tellers are frowned upon by Christianity.  The fact that he vomited in the presence of the young mysterious lady was a sign that he was the evil in the presence of God.  The moth attack on his car was not the act of the devil but the act of God.  And as Ace pointed out, he wore the same undergarment as the possessed Japanese man - a subtle hint by the filmmaker.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe young mysterious lady was a God like figure.

The goal was to confuse us a little bit using some of the traditional supernatural rituals that are often used in more generic asian horror movies pitting the good against the evil to create an exciting \"fight\" scene.  I think the point was the Shaman was doing his thing to generally try to convince people to believe in his supernatural powers - i.e. Convincing people to believe in a false god.  The ritual performed by the japanese man was actually to fight off God trying to cast the devil out of him which succeeded.  The mysterious lady God figure showed up right after it was done.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe zombie was the dead man that got possessed by the devil after it was cast out of the Japanese man by the mysterious lady.

Here is an average joe that really couldn't do anything right.  He appeared a bit male chauvinistic and lacked any kind of conviction.  At the end of the movie, he simply didn't have enough faith and got his family killed (I don't blame him though since it would've been hard on anyone to make a decision either way.)  And also at the end of the movie when the devil revealed himself in his true form in the cave, he said to the priest aid - if you already believe I'm the devil, then I'm already the devil.  Reverse that, if you don't believe there is God, then there is no God.  I think the point here was the devil didn't need to reveal himself for us to believe in his existence (the priest aid already \"knew\" he was the devil) but we often expect God to reveal himself before we believe in him (as the policeman didn't trust the mysterious lady at the end.).  Bad things happen and we think they're the devil's acts.

Nevertheless, one thing is for sure, they rock! Unknown to the rest of the band, Dylan and Mike have decided to go solo; unfortunately they choose to play their last gig at a rave at the notorious Club 905 a performance that will change their lives forever. When club owner Guy Johnson runs out of alcohol he quickly loses the crowds. Mysteriously the band finds itself trapped in the cavernous, old meat packing plant that is now Club 905, along with Guy's red-hot, intriguing girlfriend Star and Dylan's sweetie Vanessa Jones lovingly called Jonesy. Tension increases when the mutilated body of a flirty groupie turns up in a meat locker and the group realizes they are locked in with a vicious killer.

The closest we can come is item #14, \"Dark Silhouettes Against Backlight\", which talks about that technique's \"quiet, intense drama\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, first, you're not crazy or picayune to notice this or to consider it an effect. It IS an effect, even if it's not done in a computer! It's a technique that long predates Spielberg. Offhand, I can recall its use in '40s/'50s Westerns, and I suspect we would find it goes back to German Expressionism.  I wouldn't be surprised to find there was some improvement in camera technology post-War that made shots like this possible using just the sun (versus staged lighting as would've been done in the '00s, '10s and '20s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can break down the \"why\" with two questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow does it look?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow does it make us feel?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first is senior, I'd say. If we like what we see, if we're pleased by it, aesthetically, we are more likely to go along with the rest of the film. First and foremost, in other words, we must \"buy in\". If we don't buy in, we never get to the second. So it's always possible that the answer to \"why\" is \"because it looks cool\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat aside, how does lighting in shots make us feel? Let's do some easy ones:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZbPj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZbPj.jpg\" alt=\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lighting suggests \"mystery\" but not \"threat\". It suggest \"heaven\", not a little. We feel excited, but if we're scared it's an excited feeling, like a roller coaster, not a \"the shark's gonna eat us\" feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/y7arY.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/y7arY.png\" alt=\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere the lighting also says \"mystery\" but in a different way. This is more like \"weird\" in the pulp sense (otherworldly), scary, yes, but like a comic book, not a John Carpenter film. (And, man, you could do this all day with Carpenter, too.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow about this one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/kzY5a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/kzY5a.jpg\" alt=\"Lincoln\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere we see a figure, almost divine, bathed in glowing light (last seen on our guys going into the space ship), but also looking alone, isolated, separated as it were by his sheer enlightenment. And of course with foreknowledge of his doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what did you get out of that behind-the-head lighting?

A casual viewer would almost certainly have had no idea that Jon was anything but Ned's child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor starters, as far as we know, only two people alive (as of Season 1 Episode 1) know Jon's true parentage: Ned Stark and Howland Reed. They are the only survivors of the assault on the Tower of Joy -- Rhaegar Targaryen's castle where Ned finds Lyanna. Everyone else legitimately believes that Jon is Ned's son; that includes Catelyn, though she does not know who the moter is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most obvious (and it's not very obvious) clues for \u003cem\u003eviewers\u003c/em\u003e that something is up have to do with the things we learn about Ned and Rhaegar from others who knew them. The accepted story of Jon's parentage is that Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped Lyanna Stark, and Robert and Eddard's families started a war to get her back. During that war, Ned slept with someone else and had a child that he brought back to Winterfell with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of those actions are \u003cem\u003edramatically\u003c/em\u003e out of character for Rhaegar and Ned. We see Ned as an incredibly uptight, rigidly \"proper\" person, who's constantly doing \"the right thing\" even at great risk and expense to himself. For him to sleep around on his newly betrothed fiance while she waited at home seems highly unusual. Similarly, people who knew Rhaegar (particularly when they talk about him to Dany) paint him as honorable and noble, entirely unlike his whack-job father. It seems pretty unusual for him to kidnap a woman \u003cem\u003ewhile married to someone else\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are more subtle clues in the show as well, that you can piece together:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \"real\" story of what happens to Lyanna is kept secret by Ned\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNed refuses to divulge the name of Jon Snow's \"mother\" to anyone, even Jon.

It matters of honour, sacrifice, friendship, family...A great film, painful, awful, terrific story of the authentic kamikaze fly boys in the end of the war against USA. The characters are powerful to explain to us, non Japanese fellows, what honour means. We now understand how these guys chose to give their lives for their country. And we watch their doubts, their interrogations before getting into their planes. We see for instance this young guy who could not do it because his old mother, he just thought that he had to take care of her. And when he tells her that afterwards, she says that she is ashamed of him. Painful at the most. But, I repeat, so outstanding. We find here the same actors as we usually see in yakuza movies: Koji Tsuruta, Ken Takakura - the most famous Japanese actor in the Occident after Toshiro Mifune, and Bunta Sugawara. Only Ando Noburu is missing. The director Junya Sato made many yakuzas stuff.

After all, he did go on to fight Doomsday not long after that hearing, a foe no one from the military was capable of countering, and taking Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman to take down, supposedly killing Superman in the process, something no human had managed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, as you note, shows that Bruce obtained video of other metahumans from Luthor and gave it to Diana, one of which depicts The Flash stopping a convenience store robbery. This serves to clearly establish that The Flash is at least somewhat active prior to the events of Batman v Superman. With Suicide Squad we not only see Batman helping to bring in some of the squad's members, but in a mid-credits scene we see him obtaining more exact information regarding the other metahumans he learned about in the videos he stole from Luthor. I'd argue this indicates that while he was \u003cem\u003eaware\u003c/em\u003e of the other metas out there, he didn't know who they were or where to find them, for which he had to rely on Amanda Waller to provide that information in exchange for his protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it's not directly related to the films so far, a few years ago with their The New 52 reboot of DC's comic books, the first comic released as part of that reboot was Justice League. The story begins with Batman and Green Lantern learning that rumors of the others' existence are actually true, which provides credence to the idea that even the heroes that eventually form the Justice League were unaware of one another at some point in time, only hearing rumors and stories being passed around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs such I'd argue it's entirely possible for the superheroes that will eventually be involved in Justice League late next year also don't fully believe the stories of other metahumans being out there, and in fact in a recent Comic-Con preview of Justice League, there's this bit of dialog between Cyborg and Batman:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCyborg\u003c/strong\u003e: I heard about you.

This is not the case. Keep in mind, too, that many studios own their own lighting kits for anything shot on the lots, so paying for them on a per-film basis is not really an issue. They may have to buy them to have on hand and then pay for maintenance and storage but they don't have to buy or rent new lights for every film unless the DP wants something really fancy and new... which will probably be used on future projects, so the cost gets shared. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf they're on location and have to rent, yes things can get very expensive but it really is worth the cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI underestimate the value that others place on the visual aesthetic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's amusing to me that someone who appreciates Malick's work doesn't care about aesthetic.

If anything, shooting digital requires more work on lighting, not less. Also, with the addition of LED as a lighting option in the last 10 years or so, the choices for lighting are much more varied now than they used to be. Lights are getting smaller, lighter weight, and don't put off as much heat, so they're more energy efficient and less expensive to run. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStudio contracts require the filling of potentially unnecessary positions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese positions aren't unnecessary. Even if you shoot everything you possibly can in natural or available light, that light still has to be shaped by someone. Grips still have to flag off overly bright sunlight. Someone has to pick which color temperature of bulb to put in the fixtures on set and shade off any unwanted lighting. Someone has to be there when you want to shoot at night to use actual lights to give structure to the set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMovie studios are cheap... and independent filmmakers (who I've worked with a lot) don't have money to waste... they know that if the lighting is good, they'll get a better product. If it was more cost effective to not spend a huge chunk of budget on lighting and crew, they'd do it... it's very much worth it to spend money on lighting and gaffers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Are lights a worthwhile investment?","tags":["production","cinematography","lighting"],"score":17,"question_id":59047,"answer_id":59066},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe short answer is: You've picked three of the most talented and, significantly, \u003cem\u003eindulged\u003c/em\u003e directors in history (Stanley Kubrick, Terence Malick, Milos Forman) and asked \"Why doesn't everyone work this way all the time?\" Most filmmakers can't take a year to shoot, and artificial light is more consistent, and can be used in places where there \u003cem\u003eisn't\u003c/em\u003e any natural light, like sound stages, where a substantial (most?) filming is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLonger answer to follow, on the topic of natural conditions, generally, as well as lighting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere's a reason Hollywood's in Southern California (as perfectly parodied in \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la_GKKdkXDQ\"\u003eSteve Martin's \u003cem\u003eL.A.

So basically Kate could actually simply meet this 2 years older Alex right now, it just means that Alex would have to wait 2 years from now on in order to meet her. (And in fact Alex \u003cem\u003ecannot\u003c/em\u003e wait those two years and actually seeks Kate out, based on her tellings where she would be, before Kate even knew about him and when she was still together with Morgan.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut they later make a real meeting and Alex makes a reservation in a restaurant \u003cstrong\u003e2 years in his future, which is just the next day for Kate\u003c/strong\u003e, though. But since he doesn't appear in the restaurant, Kate thinks there is no future to this love and calls the whole thing off, which causes both to persue their own lives again for the next two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, about 2 years later on Valentine's Day 2006 Alex remembers that Kate said where she would be at this day and he yet again seeks her out. And this brings us back to the beginning of the movie as \u003cstrong\u003eAlex actually is the man she saw run over by a bus\u003c/strong\u003e. At the same time Kate in 2008 coincidentally hears about Alex's death on Valentine's Day 2006 and makes the same deduction, so she hastes to the Lake House and tries to stop him from meeting her (and thus dieing). And this way \u003cstrong\u003eshe prevents his death in 2006\u003c/strong\u003e (which is where the time travel logic of the film actually breaks and we get into paradox territory, but so be it, let's just say it's a new timeline now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at this point she yet again asks him to \u003cstrong\u003ewait 2 years, for his two years older 2008 version to meet her at exactly this place\u003c/strong\u003e at the Lake House on Valentine's Day 2008. Here the movie makes a little leap in favour of the story. Since she has prevented his death in 2006, he could as well have tried to seek out Kate any time between 2006 and 2008, when she already knew about him. But in fact the timeline would actually already be changed anyway, due to Kate preventing Alex's death.

The \"Saturday Game\" is a weekly event of amateur four-on-four pond hockey played on the open ice of the town's frozen lake. The team consists of ten local townsmen of varying ages and occupations with two goalies and eight skaters publicly scrimmaging each other every Saturday. As there are only ten spots on the team, in order to make room on the roster for the younger up-and-coming town players an older more senior member of the team must be kicked off the team. After an article describing the town and its players appears in Sports Illustrated, a nationally televised exhibition game is scheduled between the NHL's New York Rangers and the hometown favorites in Mystery, Alaska.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual game play:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eDuring the match, the Mystery team take time to settle, but eventually go ahead two goals to nothing in the first period. One of the goals is scored by Stevie, who impresses the commentators with his speed. In the second period however, the Rangers score five unanswered goals. Birdie costs the team a goal through his desire to “go it alone” when he should have passed. Unwilling to accept defeat, Mystery scores two goals in the third period, including one from a pass that Birdie makes instead of shooting for goal himself. As the clock ticks down, Connor has a chance to level the scores, but his shot hits the crossbar, and the game is over, with the score at 5 – 4 to the Rangers. Both the Mystery team and spectators appear completely deflated, until Judge Burns starts clapping for them, after which even the Rangers players applaud them.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe following day the Rangers leave, and it is revealed that both Stevie Weeks and Connor Banks have been given professional contracts and fly out with the Rangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHome Town underdogs lost.

The creators of Lost made clear that the title of the show isn't just about them being lost on an island, it's about people who were lost in their own lives before getting to the island.  So the flashbacks are partly a way of showcasing the choices that these people made before getting to the island and the emptiness they felt in their own lives, and comparing that with the choices they're making now that they have a fresh start on the island, and the extent to which Island is able to give their lives greater purpose and meaning.  The flashbacks also serve to highlight how the characters were interconnected even before reaching the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet me also say that the two Season 3 episodes \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and \"Exposé\" are universally considered to be the worst episodes of Lost ever; even the creators acknowledge how bad they were.

There's a reason that Season 3 in particular contained a few dumb episodes like that: it's because ABC (the network) wouldn't give the creators an end date for the series.  The creators were eager to move to the next phase of the show, but they didn't know how many more seasons they would have, so they didn't know when they should move to the next phase.  ABC, on the other hand, wanted the show to run for as many seasons as possible, because it was so lucrative for them.  So finally the creators went to the ABC executives and basically said \"Do you see what you're doing to the show?  Lost is a show with a beginning, middle, and end, so if you don't give us an end date, we'll have to stall by producing useless flashbacks like how Jack gets his tattoos.\"  So then ABC finally agreed on an end date: the show would go on for three more seasons.  In any case, now that the creators had an end date in place, the show was finally able to progress, which is why the end of season 3 onwards is much better than the beginning of season 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Are back stories in Lost important?","tags":["lost"],"score":1,"question_id":59340,"answer_id":59392},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eI think there is a strong case that the backstories are important but you should also be aware that the alternate scenes change up through out the series.

It's not as monolithic as you make it seem. Sometimes a major studio agrees to pick up you project, you shoot in their sets, you use their equipment, personnel, etc, they distribute your film.  Cool.  Usually, those studios, wanting to only make money, are going to be risk adverse.  If you are a huge name, with a track record of making big money, with a blockbuster concept, they'll go all in for you.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey are also going to micromanage and make you compromise the artistic vision for mass appeal.

But this is a 200M film, so we want Christian Bale to be the Prince of Egypt.\"  \"And that thing where the firstborn children all get killed?  If we give them all a painful rash, instead, we're more likely to get Oprah to endorse it, plus then the moms who are going to watch will identify with having to deal with kids' rashes.\"  Or \"yeah, Jack Reacher is supposed to be a six-foot five-inch bear of a man, but let's cast Tom Cruise.\"  \"Instead of the bad guy escaping and killing the hero's best friend, let's have the hero blow him up with a hand-held rocket launcher, with a really cool one-liner before he shoots it.\"  Etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what if you don't have a big-name, blockbuster, mass-appeal McMovie to make?  Then, more likely, you, the movie maker, will use their sets, resources, distribution network, etc., but you have to assemble your own special effects people, do your own location shooting, and instead of them financing your deal, you pay them for use of their resources, pay for the other resources you need, and you have to find investors to back your movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if I line up investors, 20, 30 or more and scrape together the 100M, what happens when I only make $75M?

Money in, no money out, money gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if it was part of a larger enterprise, you are saying that a movie losing money isn't a bomb because a studio would have other, non-bombs.

Meanwhile,\n  wheelchair-user Dr. Judson has also been using Ultima to help decipher\n  Viking runes found in catacombs beneath the base, warning of a being\n  called Fenric, which has attracted Millington's attention, he\n  believing that he can gain Fenric's power. Outside the base, the\n  Doctor and Ace discover a covert squad of Soviet commandos, led by\n  Captain Sorin, who are seeking to capture Ultima; the Doctor warns\n  them to lie low, while Ace and Sorin become smitten with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe Doctor and Ace find a glowing oriental vase, a treasure captured\n  by the Vikings and left in the catacombs, but it is taken by\n  Millington when they return to the base. As Millington and Judson\n  prepare to use Ultima to decipher the writings on the vase,\n  vampire-like Haemovores begin to emerge from the sea, attack and\n  convert the English and Soviet troops and other residents into more\n  Haemovores. When Judson runs Ultima with the vase, energy strikes him\n  and he becomes infused with Fenric. Fenric begins to give orders to\n  the Ancient One, an old Haemovore in control of the other monsters, to\n  continue to assault anyone in their path. Ace is able to warn one of\n  the WRNS, Kathleen, in time for her to escape with her newborn child,\n  Audrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe Doctor reveals he has faced Fenric, an ancient evil since the dawn\n  of time, besting him by challenging him at a chess problem. Arranging\n  another chess problem in the same room where the nerve gas has been\n  stockpiled, the Doctor is able to delay Fenric, while he runs off to\n  seek a more permanent solution. Sorin, the last remaining member of\n  his squad, enters the room and prepares to shoot Fenric, but Fenric\n  reveals that Sorin is one of his \"wolves\", having descended from the\n  Vikings that carried the cursed vase to the English shores and takes\n  over his body. When Ace returns to the room, she unwittingly helps\n  Fenric, in Sorin's body, to solve the chess problem. The Doctor\n  arrives too late, as Fenric can no longer be stopped. Fenric orders\n  the Ancient One to attack the Doctor but a psychic barrier created by\n  Ace's trust in the Doctor prevents the Ancient One from acting. The\n  Doctor is forced to reveal to Ace that she too is one of Fenric's\n  pawns, as it was he that created the time storm that transported her\n  to the alien world where she met the Doctor the first time.[2]\n  Furthermore, by saving Kathleen and Audrey, she has assured that the\n  cycle remain unbroken, as Audrey will grow up to become Ace's mother\n  whom she despises. Ace's faith is shattered, causing the psychic\n  barrier to drop but, instead of attacking the Doctor, the Ancient One\n  grabs Fenric, pulls him into a sealed chamber and releases a lethal\n  dose of the gas. The chamber explodes, killing them both.

So to some degree the title sequence also is somewhat of a stage for the Bond songs, a tradition as important as the title sequences themselves.

He is joined in his quest by Ascalante, a priest of an old abandoned god whom Kull had freed earlier, and Zareta, Ascalante's sister and fortune-teller, who was a member of Kull's harem wrongfully accused of his murder by the queen and who secretly loves Kull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only way to destroy Akivasha, however, is to sail to steal the icy breath of Valka, a cave-dwelling northern god.

There's no life inside.\n  There's a \"dead\" quality to dolls that can be creepy since their eyes\n  are open, and they are often smiling and lifelike. It's the ultimate\n  dichotomy that brings to mind a child's corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eDolls can be creepy, because we expect them to be our playmates,\n  bodyguards, and best friends when we are young and vulnerable. We also\n  control their actions completely. So, for them to get up and run\n  around the house on their own, or try to strangle us, that leaves us\n  powerless and terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eIt goes back to the imagination of a child, which is so very\n  vast—because, again, a firm grasp on reality is not yet established.\n  If a child plays with a doll or a clown as if it were real, then it's\n  an easy gateway to bringing it to life. We were all once children and\n  have the memories of struggling with fantasy and reality. I think it's\n  probably often used within these films, because many can identify with\n  that feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eAs filmmakers, it's our job to reverse the expectation of the\n  audience—whether that means to shock, delight, or a combination of the\n  two. We all had one toy as a kid that we reflect back on and now\n  appears monumentally unsettling. Plenty of filmmakers take that\n  anxiety and amplify it with a big \"what if\" scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is specific to anthropomorphic toys, like dolls and teddy bears. However, all toys are \ninseparably related to children and \u003ca href=\"http://movies.stackexchange.com/q/17033/49\"\u003echildren are also a common theme in horror\u003c/a\u003e. We generally think of our smaller versions as pure and innocent and we project the same feelings on the toys. Weapons or similar objects are generally perceived negatively. If you deal with an evil toy instead it simply adds an additional shock value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eIn the modern world, nothing is more revered than children, as they\n  are the embodiment of innocence. And for that innate innocence to be\n  contaminated by something evil or corrupt or dangerous is inherently\n  mysterious and disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eI think at its core, horror is about the unpredictability and\n  vulnerability of life; the knowledge that, as safe and serene as\n  things may seem, and as much as we strive to create a bubble of safety\n  and continuity for ourselves, around any corner and at any future\n  moment may come death, pain, loss, psychological trauma, or another\n  form of terror. Depictions of evil or otherwise unsettled children\n  play into this so well, as we often view them as human life at its\n  most \"innocent\" and \"uncorrupted\"; to see them as an agent of evil is\n  to know that nothing and no one in life can be completely trusted.\n  \u003cstrong\u003eAlong the same lines, children are also seen as human life at its most\n  \"cute,\" and so a dangerous child pushes some of the same buttons in a\n  horror movie as would an evil dog, gremlin, robot, alien, or other\n  exaggerated \"cute\" form that transforms into something dangerous.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"Why are dolls, teddy bears, etc. used as horror objects in horror films?","tags":["analysis","horror","film-techniques","props"],"score":38,"question_id":59985,"answer_id":59990}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":5014,"entidades":1.0}

He doesn't seem to take kindly to being called insane here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we look at the parallels, Alicia wouldn't react much differently in the same position. The moment she sees The Joker she faints earlier on in the movie. In the next scene we see her, she is wearing the mask, asking where Jack is going.  But the way in which she asks is clearly abnormal. It's safe to assume she is drugged, mostly likely self medicated. In the museum scene, we see she's been completely disfigured on one side of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving sort of established what type of person the Joker is and the way in which he reacts to people who reject him, it's probably safe to assume in a fit of rage he disfigured Alicia Hunt due to her not wanting to be with him anymore or some other form of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the character description you linked of her.

He also targeted Circe and forcibly\n  disfigured her with the chemicals in order to force her to reunite\n  with him. Circe would ultimately kill herself, leading Black Mask to\n  replace her with a mannequin that he talked to as if it were a real\n  person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we put all this together, it seems the Joker did in fact kill Alicia Hunt. Looking at the quote you provided it's obvious there is some rage in his voice when he reveals that you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. He then proceeds to smash the mask with his fist, almost as if he was finishing the very last bit of her he had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn speculation, it seems Alicia probably yelled at the Joker in a fit of clarity, with a combination of several emotions.  One was most definitely resentment and great anger. She was also sad what he had done to her and most likely fearing for her life. And finally, he is pursuing Vicki Vale, which is making her feel abandoned and hopeless. Anything she might have said to him to show she was leaving or rejecting him, probably repeated events we have already seen The Joker do throughout the whole movie -- he killed her in a fit of rage by pushing her out the window. And just like Joker in several other mediums we have seen, he lied about the events or in \u003cstrong\u003ehis mind\u003c/strong\u003e she actually did kill herself. But in reality, unlike the Black Mask story, the Joker was the one to commit the crime and to achieve his goals lied about the incident to make Vicki Vale feel sorry for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Did the Joker kill Alicia Hunt?","tags":["plot-explanation","batman-1989"],"score":3,"question_id":59989,"answer_id":60029}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":5011,"entidades":1.0}

We cannot trust the main character since their memory is completely unreliable. Besides Leonard, Teddy would be the most knowledgeable character. His memory is in tact, but he often lies to Leonard to manipulate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo there is a dilemma, the narration of the film is unreliable and contradictory. It is also shown out of order to further complicate matters. Fortunately, there is an Easter egg hidden in the DVD release which will allow you to watch it in chronological order. While this doesn't explain everything, we can more easily see how everything fits together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul's answer is partially correct, but has some details wrong. According to Teddy, Leonard often lies to himself to make him feel better. Teddy states that Sammy Jenkis was in fact a real person, but Leonard has the story mixed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeonard did investigate Sammy's case, and believed he was a fraud. Sammy was in a car accident where he suffered a head injury. Leonard believed he was lying because Sammy would act like he recognized him when he came to the door. What Leonard did not realize at the time is that Sammy faked responses to act more normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Leonard's memories of Sammy's case, he had a wife that was a diabetic. Sammy's wife would routinely test his memory by hiding objects all over the house, and then she would try to get him to remember where he had left them. The strange thing about his injury is that he still was able to do complex tasks such as give his wife insulin. Since he had learned how to do that before the injury, he could still perform it. Now, his wife had become very depressed for some reason (we will get to that in a bit). One day, she tried in vain to get him to remember. She would call him repeatedly and have him do the insulin injection. Since Sammy could reliably perform this task, he did it every time she asked him to. Eventually, he gave her so much insulin that she fatally overdosed. Sammy was never able to fully reconcile what he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Teddy, Sammy actually had no wife. Sammy was real, but the story Leonard tells about him was not true. It was Leonard's wife that was diabetic, and it was Leonard that unwittingly killed her. Leonard's wife was also very depressed. Not only was she depressed about her husband, she was also depressed because of the attack. Whether or not she committed suicide is completely up for debate, but it was clear that she was not happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe psychology behind Leonard's character is very complex. He was diagnosed with a form of amnesia called anterograde amnesia. People with this form of amnesia have difficulty creating new memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAnterograde amnesia is a loss of the ability to create new memories after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe also appears to have some other undiagnosed symptoms. Leonard also shows signs of having an illness called prosopagnosia, commonly known as face blindness. Prosopagnosia can also be caused by a brain injury, and it is likely he is also suffering from a form of it called associative prosopagnosia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eAssociative prosopagnosia has typically been used to describe cases of acquired prosopagnosia  ... People with this form of the disorder may be able to see whether photos of people's faces are the same or different and derive the age and sex from a face (suggesting they can make sense of some face information) but may not be able to subsequently identify the person or provide any information about them such as their name, occupation, or when they were last encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis fact was alluded to due to the fact that he could look at a picture, and compare it to someone, but he cannot associate that image with any of his memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only truth was at the end when Teddy confessed to Leonard, and he told him what really happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Does Leonard really have memories before the incident?","tags":["plot-explanation","memento"],"score":2,"question_id":60156,"answer_id":60942},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eLeonard is the classic unreliable narrator; and he even warns us of this when he tells us that memories cannot be trusted, that they can be distorted.

This is proved in the a couple of ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe repeated scenes where Leonard remembers 'pinching' his wife on the leg - in exactly the same spot where Sammy gives his 'wife' an insulin injection.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThroughout the film we have seen the same scene of Sammy sitting in the nursing home after his wife's suicide. At the end of the film when Teddy tries to force Leonard to remember we return to this scene, only this time, when a nurse walks past, we briefly see that it is Leonard.

And, as Leonard explains, he can't ever process his grief (and guilt) over his wife's death because the memory of doing so doesn't stick. All he's stuck with the repeated act of killing her, over and over. So he constructs an elaborate fantasy to escape that knowledge.

However, it turned out at that point that the production rights and distribution rights on the Hobbit were owned by different parties. To the best of my knowledge they decided to continue solely with Lord Of The Rings afterwards. This project went through quite some production hell (going from 2 movies to 1 to almost none to 3). Only after the extreme success of those movies the team started looking at the Hobbit again. That also took some time because first those rights had to be obtained and secondly there were some legal struggles between Jackson and New Line Cinemas. However, eventually everything was settled and the films were also made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow the following is more subjective, but as you mentioned the digitial effects specifically, I want to comment on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople tends to overestimate the role of technology and technology evolution. First of all, technology evolution is relatively limited, most computer rendering methods are already quite old. For example, ray tracing was developed late 60's/early 70's. Recent evolution only provides a few things on top of that: more processing power (and memory) and improved tools. In the end it depends at least as much on the skill of the artist how good the results look, and together with that also on how much time they're given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first is for cinema actually less of an issue, as there is no need to render frames in real time, so whether one has to wait 1minute or 1 day for a final, production frame to render is not important (for big budget productions). Same goes for memory, it mainly makes it go faster, but if you don't have enough RAM nothing stops you from rendering from (a set of) SDD/HDD's.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is more important, because better tools (should) save time. Suppose for example you are working on a render of a forest. If you have a tool that's optimized to generate quite realistic vegetation as a start, you'll be up to speed a lot faster than when you have to design everything from scratch. If the tool also provides a way to model a breeze through that vegetation, then your animation task also becomes easier, etc. etc. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for LOTR specifically Weta Digital created those tools themselves, most famous example (also mentioned in the question): they needed to model huge armies so they made a tool for that called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASSIVE_(software)\"\u003eMASSIVE\u003c/a\u003e, which was later actually reused to do some of the work on Avatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, don't underestimate how much 'special effects' in Lord of the Rings and even more recent movies is done using good old props. For Lord of the rings this was again done by Weta. Here CGI technology evolution would again have little to no impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo in the end it seems unlikely that the more than 10 years of technological advantage would have made a huge difference for lord of the rings.

Because the CGI is added in later, the FX team will just adjust their graphics so that the character shows up where the actor is actually looking, as much as they can. This technique is also used when actors need to maniuplate (touch, hold, pet, etc) CGI creatures, to give them something tangible to work with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ptKdX.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ptKdXm.jpg\" alt=\"Amelia Clarke and a tennis ball\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eStand-ins.

Regional locks are designed not for different television formats but for marketing purposes: distributors want the freedom to control regional marketing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual regional lock matches a code on the disk with a code in the decoding device and refuses permission to decode a disk from a different region.

In Europe, for example, analog TV was 25 fps to match the mains electricity frequency of 50 Hz. Analogue movies on TV were sped up from their 24 fps on film to 25fps for TV broadcast to avoid nasty artefacts cause by the frequency mismatch. in the USA where mains is 60hz and TV is 30fps, more complex schemes had to be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this matters in a digital world especially when the DVD signal is transmitted via a digital interface and never needs to go via an analogue TV signal.

First, the cipher doesn't appear to use a fixed shift for every substitution. (I maps to P, a shift of 7. L maps to Z, a shift of 14.) Second, this message is much shorter, making it impossible to use letter frequency to guess any of the letters. We can use the message and its encrypted form to create a partial cipher alphabet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ - plain text alphabet\n    E   P  Z  Q     RA  T  - cipher text alphabet\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe shifts appear to be random.

After being dumped by her boyfriend for \"not having\n  a sense of adventure\", Wanda is informed by a letter that her father,\n  an archaeologist, has died. She flies to North Africa and while going\n  through her father's belongings, she finds his notes about Atlantis,\n  apparently an alien ship that crashed millennia ago and sank into the\n  center of the Earth. Wanda comes across a chamber beneath her father's\n  apartment and accidentally sets off a chain of events that ultimately\n  cause her to fall into a deep hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eAn unharmed Wanda wakes up deep within the Earth to find Gus (William\n  R. Moses), a miner whom she protects from being slain by two people.\n  Gus, who has a very inconsistent Australian accent, agrees to help\n  Wanda find her father, whom she believes is alive and trapped\n  underground. Wanda soon discovers that both she and her father are\n  believed to be spies planning an invasion of Atlantis. During her\n  adventures, Wanda's appearance changes from nerdy to attractive (by\n  removing her glasses and using a steam vent to clean her skin). People\n  from the surface world are referred to as \"aliens\" by Atlanteans, who\n  appear virtually identical to surface dwellers, and when Wanda is\n  overheard talking about Malibu Beach by a low-life informant (Janie Du\n  Plessis), she soon becomes a hunted woman and must dodge efforts at\n  capture, both from the mysterious \"Government House\" and from thugs in\n  the pay of the crime lord Mambino (Deep Roy). During these sequences,\n  many references to Wanda's \"big bones\" are made, as though it were a\n  trait by which she could be identified; however, no obvious physical\n  distinction between Wanda and the Atlanteans is noticeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eWanda's efforts at escape are aided by Charmin (Thom Matthews), a\n  handsome rogue who (briefly) assists her flight and falls for Wanda.\n  She is ultimately captured by the evil General Pykov (Du Plessis\n  again), who wants to kill both Wanda and her incarcerated father. The\n  Atlantean leader decides to free Wanda and her father, provided they\n  remain quiet about Atlantis. Gus shows up and helps the duo escape\n  while fighting off General Pykov and her soldiers. Wanda and her\n  father board a ship that takes them back to the surface and the film\n  ends with Wanda on the beach, wearing a bikini and a sarong. She\n  refuses the advances of her ex-boyfriend and is soon reunited with\n  Charmin, who inexplicably appears on a motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/X32zz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/X32zz.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1r7iC.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1r7iC.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kd32L.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kd32L.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HtzVh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HtzVh.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Xva7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Xva7.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092532/?ref_=fn_al_tt_8\"\u003eIMDB\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-SclSgWSa4\"\u003eTrailer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Teen discovers underground world under her father\u0026#39;s house","tags":["identify-this-movie"],"score":5,"question_id":61065,"answer_id":61068}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":3934,"entidades":1.0}

Therefore, trading him and getting another team to pay at least half of that amount still freed up $4 million for the Yankees to use in signing one or more players to replace Justice, but the point of Beane noting this to Justice, I feel, is accurate albeit with a slightly more malicious intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What does Billy Beane mean by \u0026quot;Yankees are paying half your salary\u0026quot;?","tags":["plot-explanation","dialogue","moneyball"],"score":35,"question_id":61519,"answer_id":61523},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eIt's a pretty common occurrence in professional sports for a team to be responsible for part of a player's salary if they are traded midway through a contract.  \u003ca href=\"http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2009/11/trades-of-the-decade-arod-for-soriano.html\"\u003eAlex Rodriguez was paid by the Rangers while he was a Yankee\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What does Billy Beane mean by \u0026quot;Yankees are paying half your salary\u0026quot;?","tags":["plot-explanation","dialogue","moneyball"],"score":21,"question_id":61519,"answer_id":61522}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":3481,"entidades":1.0}

There have now been four versions of Barry's life history\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the \u003cem\u003eoriginal\u003c/em\u003e original timeline, Barry grew up with a mom and dad, and eventually became the Flash sometime around 2020.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the Season 1 timeline, distant-future-Thawne travels back to 2000 and kills Barry's mom. He then impersonates Harrison Well's and makes Barry into The Flash in 2014.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the \"Flashpoint\" timeline, 2016-Barry-Allen travels back to 2000 and stops distant-future-Thawne from killing Nora Allen. He then returns back to 2016. In this timeline, young Barry Allen slept through the whole mess, and grows up with both parents, but somehow still has his Speed Force powers by 2016.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the post-\"Flashpoint\" timeline, 2016-Barry-Allen travels back to 2000 to stop distant-future-Thawne from killing Nora, then travels back \u003cem\u003ea second time\u003c/em\u003e to \"fix\" his mistake. This Barry we know very little about, presumably we'll figure it out as the season unfolds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote that 2000 \"child\" Barry Allen always grows up until 2016 \"adult\" Barry Allen in every timeline, and he always gets his powers in every timeline. The difference is what his childhood is like during that 16 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's also important to note that, as a Speedster, Barry (and Thawne) have some degree of \u003cem\u003enatural\u003c/em\u003e immunity to time paradoxes, because of their access to the Speed Force.  This is why, for example, they both remember the previous timeline when no one else does. It also explains how Nora's still alive, if Barry never knew he needed to go back and save her from Thawne, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as we are told, young Barry grew up not knowing there was anything odd about his life, right up until he reached the point in the timeline where Season 2 Barry \"comes back\", and from then forward he has his Season 2 memories. As the episode goes on, it appears as if \"new\" Barry's memories are starting to replace \"previous\" Barry's memories. This is the new timeline trying to impose it's will on Barry, again with some vague connection to the Speed Force.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What happened to the child Barry Allen in The Flash S3 Premiere?","tags":["arrowverse","the-flash"],"score":5,"question_id":61569,"answer_id":61573},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eHe grew up - time travel is (to paraphrase) wibbly wobbly and sometimes you just have to go with it.

Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and\n  wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed man—later identified as Philippe\n  LaRoche (Vincent Cassel)—bursts into the hotel room, beats Charles,\n  and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda agree not to report\n  the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair.\n  Shortly after, Charles is blackmailed by LaRoche, who threatens to\n  kill his family if he does not pay $20,000, which Charles promptly\n  pays.

He\n  and Winston travel to the meeting location specified by LaRoche,\n  intending to get the drop on him. However, before they can act,\n  Winston is shot and killed. LaRoche appears and takes the money,\n  leaving Charles to dispose of the body. Afterwards, Charles is\n  questioned by detective Franklin Church (Giancarlo Esposito) about\n  Winston's murder. Later, Charles receives a call from LaRoche who\n  claims that he will kill Lucinda if Charles doesn't deliver the\n  $100,000.

Seeing that Lucinda's photograph of her\n  daughter was actually a cut out of a stock picture in a brochure,\n  Charles realizes Jane was in on the scam. He tracks her down and sees\n  her kissing LaRoche. Determined to retrieve his stolen money, he\n  follows Jane's moves and sees that she is seducing another\n  unsuspecting businessman (David Morrissey). He rents a room in the\n  same hotel where Jane, LaRoche, and their partner Dexter (Xzibit) set\n  him up and awaits them as they snare their new target. Jane and the\n  businessman go to the room, but Charles knocks LaRoche unconscious\n  before he can follow them. Charles breaks in and demands the return of\n  his money.

There, Charles\n  finds LaRoche, who survived the gunfight. LaRoche threatens to\n  continue to disrupt Charles's life, but Charles reveals that he has\n  planned the encounter. He produces a shank, which Winston had given\n  him, and stabs LaRoche to death.

The \"in practice, if not yet by law\", in my opinion, simply means that she will obey him and honor him as if they were already legally married. Also, if you read the original script in the scene where Rose and Cal are setting up their stateroom right after they board the ship Cal says something along the lines of \"And when I crawl between the sheets, I'll still be the first.The first and only. Forever. (Rose realizes how bleak a prospect this is for her)\" Cameron left that out of the final cut.

In fact Ferris was the one who pretended to be the doctor who seemingly gets shot in the beginning of the story.  And while pretending to be the doctor, he has an allergic reaction to the bonding agent used in the fake beard, and the allergic reaction causes symptoms that makes Langdon suspect that Ferris is the carrier of the virus.  In any case, Ferris is directed by the Consortium to hand Langdon and Sienna over to the WHO, so to escape Sienna makes it seem that Ferris is having a heart attack and she's performing CPR on him, when really she is incapacitating him.  In any case, by the end of the novel Ferris is fine and he explains everything to Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the movie Jonathan Ferris is replaced by a black guy named Christoph Bouchard, who really is a WHO agent and not a Consortium actor at all.  In fact the Consortium actor who plays the doctor in the beginning plays no further role in the movie.  In any case, in the movie Bouchard is a corrupt WHO agent who is trying to sell the Inferno virus to the highest bidder.  He is killed by the Provost of the Consortium, which brings me to the second difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Consortium is far more violent in the movie than in the book.  In the book, Langdon calls the U.S. Embassy but he's really talking to a Consortium person.  And them Vayentha is sent to the hotel across the street in order to make Langdon think the U.S. government is after him, to build trust between Langdon and Sienna so that Langdon will solve the puzzle for Sienna.    But the Consortium's plan goes awry when Langdon accesses his email account from Sienna's laptop, which causes the WHO to find out his location.  When the Provost finds out that the WHO is coming, he decides to abort the operation.  In any case, when Vayentha points a gun at Langdon when they're atop the scaffold, she was planning to shoot the gun at him to show him that it only fires blanks and this was all a deception.  So Sienna kills Vayentha in order to prevent her from revealing the truth, all the while pretending that she was saving Langdon's life from Vayentha.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the movie, after Langdon and Sienna flee the apartment, the Provost issues a kill order for Langdon, which is something that the book's version of the Consortium would never do since they're just an acting troop.  (Although Vayentha does worry in the book that the Provost might have her killed.)  In any case, in the scaffold scene in the movie Vayentha has a real gun with bullets, and Sienna really does save Langdon's life from Vayentha.  Also, in the movie the Provost is a much more violent guy, someone who has a collection of weird-shaped knives which he uses when needed.  Finally, I think in the movie the Provost may have been killed in the end, whereas in the book he's arrested for the role he played in helping Zobrist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eSiena's character is changed significantly in the movie.  In the book, although Langdon and the WHO think that Sienna is trying to release the virus, in reality she's just trying to get to it first in order to destroy it.  She doesn't trust the WHO to destroy it since the government might want to preserve it as a biological weapon.  In the movie, she's blind follower of Zobrist who really does want to release the virus, and she closes the window on Langdon in Venice so she can release the virus in Istanbul.  And in the movie she's ultimately killed while trying to release the virus.  Whereas in the book, she survives and she plans to become an advocate for keeping the effects of the virus as they are.  Which brings me to the next difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe nature of the virus is dramatically changed in the movie.  In the book, everyone including Sienna assumes the virus is lethal, but in reality what it does is it renders a third of the Earth's population infertile, in order to solve the\nproblem of overpopulation.  In the movie, the virus really is lethal, and there's a big fight scene at the end where it's prevented from being released.  In the book, the virus is actually released, in fact Zobrist released it a week earlier and it just took a week to spread over the world.

The Consortium is portrayed as a sinister spy organization for a very long time, and it's only at the end that it's revealed to be an acting troupe.  In the movie the acting troupe revelation is a minor plot twist.  Also, the movie reveals right in the beginning that the agents chasing Langdon work for the World Health Organization, whereas in the book they're portrayed as mysterious agents wearing green medallions and their true identity is only revealed when they capture Langdon.  Finally, there's a long segment of the book where it seems like Jonathan Ferris (the equivalent of Cristoph Bouchard) is working for Zobrist, whereas in the movie the audience only thinks that for a small amount of time during the train scene and its aftermath, before it's revealed that he's motivated by greed.  In the book it's only at the very end that it's revealed that Ferris works for the Consortium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe movie adds a whole past relationship between Robert Langdon and s WHO director which is completely absent in the book.

Some books don't translate well to the screen, but in this case I think a more faithful adaptation would have done much better in the box office and with critics.  The whole element of keeping the audience fooled might have made this into a Christopher Nolan-like movie with a mind-blowing twist at the end.  Instead they decided to make it a standard Hollywood action movie.  Dan Brown's other novels are pretty formulaic and fit better with the standard action movie plot, but Inferno was in my opinion Dan Brown's most creative novel.

It's the tvs that are applying an effect. Let me explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo fool the human brain into believing that a series of flashes are a continuous, moving image, the flashes have to come at a minimum of between 50-60 Hz (cycles per second). The chemicals available in the early days of motion picture film simply weren't fast enough to get a good exposure at that speed--and it would have taken a LOT of film. (In 35mm, that's almost 1.5 meters of film going through the camera every second!) It was realized that you could cheat by flashing the same frame multiple times. Standard motion picture film, though only shot at 24 frames per second, sits behind a spinning shutter that looks something like a radiation symbol: As it spins, it flashes each frame three times: 3*24=72 Hz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen video came along, it used a different method of cheating. Video cameras would record (and tvs would play back) every other line of an image, alternating between even and odd at (in North America) 59.94 Hz. This means that effectively tv was playing back motion at ~60Hz, rather than flashing the same frame 3 times. It's a subtle effect, but it's one that our brains can sort-of detect: The motion in a native video image is \"sharper\" than film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eModern HD tvs can display full frames of video at 60 Hz. To show off this feature, some \u003cstrike\u003eidiot\u003c/strike\u003e one realized that, by adding a cheap frame interpolation chip, any source--including movies shot at 24 fps--could be nudged up to 60 Hz. (I say cheap because the same frame interpolation was already available as a transition on the first generation of DV camcorders back when I was in college.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere soap operas come in is their speed of production. To save time, they've always been shot with studio cameras, on video. Contrast this with bigger budget shows like \"Gilligan's Island\" or \"M*A*S*H\", which were shot on 16mm film and then transferred to video. It's entirely cultural. We've grown up with \"big budget\" material having that slower, more dreamlike motion of low frame rates, while soap operas have a sharper, jarringly more real motion. That's the \"soap opera effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why do soap operas have the soap opera effect?","tags":["effects","cinematography"],"score":5,"question_id":62298,"answer_id":62791}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":2701,"entidades":1.0}

Among those who espouse\n  film genre studies, epic is one of the most despised and ignored\n  genres\"[3] Finally, although the American Movie Channel formally\n  defines epic films as historical films, they nonetheless state the\n  epic film may be combined with the genre of science-fiction and cite\n  Star Wars as an example.[4]\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eStylistically, films classed as epic usually employ spectacular\n  settings and specially designed costumes, often accompanied by a\n  sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars. Epics\n  are usually among the most expensive of films to produce. They often\n  use on-location filming, authentic period costumes, and action scenes\n  on a massive scale. Biographical films may be less lavish versions of\n  this genre.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eMany writers may refer to any film that is \"long\" (over two hours) as\n  an epic, making the definition epic a matter of dispute, and raise\n  questions as to whether it is a \"genre\" at all. As Roger Ebert put it,\n  in his \"Great Movies\" article on Lawrence of Arabia:[5]\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eThe word epic in recent years has become synonymous with big budget B\n  picture. What you realize watching Lawrence of Arabia is that the word\n  epic refers not to the cost or the elaborate production, but to the\n  size of the ideas and vision.

This influences their status as \"bankable\" stars because having their name attached to the movie will draw people to watch the film that might have not watched it otherwise. This additional draw is the \"bankability\" of the star, and relies on people recognizing the name (weak) as well as whether they recall enjoying this actors films in the past (strong).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would also say that A-list status and bankability aren't always hand-in-hand even though they are very related. One handy heuristic I'd offer for bankability is if the movie is being described among your peers as \"the new \" then that actor is probably a bankable star for your peer. The fact that the movie is described as a certain actor's film means that actor is bankable in direct relation to the number of people talk favorably about it in those terms. For example Scarlett Johansson by box office take is \u003ca href=\"http://collider.com/scarlett-johansson-box-office/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ein the top 10 highest grossing stars\u003c/a\u003e by box office take. This clearly gives her A-list status (because many people know her name due to the success of her movies), but I don't know if I would consider her as bankable as Tom Cruise.

As it turns out I hated the movie, so now I'll be more careful about renting a movie based on her presence in the future. This is why actors need to balance accepting any role that comes their way to earn money and stay on the public's radar with avoiding movies that are likely to flop. To bring this back to my example Reese Witherspoon definitely earned money with her starring role in \u003cem\u003eHot Pursuit\u003c/em\u003e but her bankability suffered with me.

Formulaically, we describe null as \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e and the inverse of zero would be infinity: \u003ccode\u003e1/0\u003c/code\u003e. Since \u003ccode\u003ex/0\u003c/code\u003e has no algebraic solution, the \u003cem\u003eDe L'Hôpital\u003c/em\u003e approach would treat the denominator as the width of a differential. Dividing a differential of any size (\u003ccode\u003edx\u003c/code\u003e) by a null differential (\u003ccode\u003ed0\u003c/code\u003e) is essentially equivalent to driving the denominator towards nullity. You cannot really divide by nothing, but we can conceptually speak of what it means to divide by \"something\" that is approaching a dimensional-metric (a width) of \"nothingness\". All in all, this is the concept of a Singularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn our reality, we perceive of a 4-dimensional space-time. Our three spatial dimensions (height, width, and depth) vary along the unidirectional dimension of time; meaning that we only ever seem to go forwards in time. It's like time is a force, like gravity, and our universe is falling under its force, and we can't fight against it to go backwards. But if someone is pushing on you with a force, though you may not be strong enough to push back, that doesn't mean you can't \u003cem\u003ego around them\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf reality, beyond our perception, is hyperdimensional to our 4-D perceptions, then there exist fifth and sixth dimensions and beyond, such that if we could move along those dimensions we could go around time and essentially end up forwards or backwards in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this concept of dimensionality, a singularity -- an infinitude -- is a point of convergence, where all (or some) dimensionalities reach their limit. Dimensionality, for perceptual understanding and practical considerations, requires an origin, a limit, and a progression -- meaning that dimensionality must consist of a \"\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003emetric space\u003c/a\u003e\". As a measured dimensionality -- a metric space -- there is a nullity and an infinity. All points are measures from the nullity towards the infinity. If we picture our 3-D space as a sphere, the surface of that sphere is the infinity of our space, with the nullity (origin) at the center of the sphere. Infinity in this sense can be positive or negative, and has directionality in relation to the 3 components (call them \u003ccode\u003ex\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ey\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003ez\u003c/code\u003e) of our space. You can be at infinity in one, all three, or some combination of the dimensions, but you always end up on the sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other conceptual constructions of a multi-dimensional space, like a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eProjective Space\u003c/a\u003e (the spherical model is called Euclidean or Cartesian Space), there is only 1 infinity, a singular point of infinity, and the origin is actually a point, disc, sphere, or hypersphere. This is mostly conceptual, but there's a reality to it in the sense of modelling optics and light and abstract dimensional-scaling. In the Projective Space, the point at infinity is a singularity, as all infinities are, and it behaves like a \"black hole\". You can conceptually map points \u003cstrong\u003ethrough\u003c/strong\u003e the point at infinity, linking positive points to negative points, and the \"sign\" (negativity or positivity) of a point takes-on a meaning of directionality. By mapping \u003cstrong\u003ethrough\u003c/strong\u003e infinity, you create inversions, you \"flip\" every direction. So if a body, a collection of points, could pass through the singularity at the point of infinity, it would come out the \"other side\" inverted -- inside-out and upside-down, in every dimensionality of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we go back to Euclidean space, what happens when hit the surface of the sphere, but then keep travelling? Do you end up moving back towards the origin from where you hit -- did you bounce off the sphere? Or do you move towards the origin from the exact opposite side of the sphere? Which would be similar to Futurama episode (\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/19573468\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eS06E07\u003c/a\u003e, \"The Late Philip J. Fry\"), where they go so far forward in time that they \"come out the other side\" and \"catch up\" with where they left off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the concept of the \"black hole\" or the \"worm hole\". Singularities, points in dimensional space-time, that are connected to other points and allow for \"teleportation\". More conceptually, the singularity, leading back to the divide-by-zero issue, is a logical fallacy. How can you have a metric space, but be free to teleport from within the metric space? How does that not break all the concepts and reality of the measure(s) between discrete points in the space?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt does. But what if the space, the 4-dimensions, existed \u003cstrong\u003einside of\u003c/strong\u003e a higher dimensional reality?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow imagine that there is a 13-dimensional reality, and space-time is only 4 of those 13 dimensions. What appears like a singularity, a divide by zero, in our 4-dimensions (ex: \u003ccode\u003e[1, 1, 1, 1] / [0, 0, 0, 0]\u003c/code\u003e) is only such because it is null in our 4 dimensions but is non-null in other dimensions (ex: \u003ccode\u003e[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] / [0, 0, 0, 0, w]\u003c/code\u003e). We still have a divide-by-zero issue, but going back to (\u003cem\u003eDe L'Hôpital\u003c/em\u003e), that means that it's just beyond our language; we aren't really dividing by zero, we're \u003cstrong\u003eheading towards\u003c/strong\u003e an inverse nullity, which is really an infinity. But that means we're only heading towards infinity in our dimensions. In other dimensions we could be anywhere. So we might be at infinite time and infinite space points, but what if gravity has a dimensionality, a scale of its strength, we're at the \u003ccode\u003e+9.8\u003c/code\u003e point of gravity, so what if we \"circumvent\" time by going to the \u003ccode\u003e-10.2\u003c/code\u003e point of gravity then come back around to a \"previous\" point in time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo\u003c/strong\u003e, an \"Infinity Stone\", conceptually, seems to exist as a singularity point, a point at infinity, for its dimensionality. The \"Time Gem\", exists as the singularity for time, but allows free travel -- as the holder is so able to do -- in all other dimensions. Because you can travel freely -- in the limits of your abilities -- in all other dimensions, you can circumvent time. It's like time is a line drawn down the center of a room. If you travel along the line, you can't ever escape it, you're moving only forwards or backwards in time. But you're in a room, a room of many dimensions beyond this line. Imagine jumping over the line, running around the line, falling onto the line... you can go around it however you want, so long as you leave the line. But if you've left the line, where are you \"on\" the line? How did you \"get off of the line\"? Leaving the line, leaving \"time\", you've jumped out of the dimensionality, you've escaped into other dimensionalities, you've gone past the origin and the inverse origin, you've gone through the singularity. You are at \"infinity\" in time, meaning that you are anywhere except at a point in time; you're not at the beginning or the end, you're \u003cem\u003ebeyond\u003c/em\u003e. All things that are beyond time are immeasurable and innumerable by time, so they all \"exist\" at a singularity, at the infinity point \"in\" time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, Dormammu is in a \"Dark Dimension\" -- this is bad grammar and should be referred to as a \"Dark Space\" of at least 3-dimensions, because we see at least 3-dimensions during the movie; it's clearly not a single \"dimension\". The space of Dormammu, the dimensionality seems to have at least our similar 3 spatial dimensions, but as a space \"beyond time\", that is a grammatically tolerable way of saying that there is no \"time dimensionality\" to that space. If there's no \"time\", then things can move, but they aren't moving in time, they're moving either purely spatially, thus never changing/evolving temporally but rather  becoming new spatial points, being destroyed and recreated as something technically different with every \"motion\" -- which seems pretty \"dark\" and f***ked up, right? Or there are other dimensions, like gravity or electromagnetism or things we have no concepts for, or maybe even \"Love\" is a dimension; right, \"Interstellar\"?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it's a space without a time dimension, that's what it means to be \"beyond time\". The \"time gem\" is a singularity of time, an infinity, but that means that it exists in all other possible dimensions, so even if Dormammu's space has no time dimension, Dr. Strange can use the gem to travel \"around time\" in some other dimensions -- whichever ones he's comfortable traversing through -- and impose a \"time loop\" on the reality space that Dormammu exists within. Dormammu is stuck because the Time Gem is a worm-hole allowing Dr. Strange to travel through other dimensions, even \"beyond\" the point-in-time of his death. So when Dormammu kills him, he just returns to the \"checkpoint\" in time that he registered himself to with the \"spell\" cast using the Time Gem and the \"magical artifact\" it's held inside of. Now, this would mean that Dormammu could have saved itself by stealing the Time Gem from Dr. Strange and using it itself to go \"around\" the time loop; but clearly it didn't understand what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is the looming threat of collecting all the Infinity Gems into a Gauntlet of Power. If someone ends up with all the Infinity Gems -- Soul, Time, Space, Mind, Reality, and Power -- they have control of 6 singularities among the \u003ccode\u003eN\u003c/code\u003e total dimensions of all of reality. For each Gem, that means they can freely \"escape\" that dimension and traverse the others to manipulate \"reality\" in that Gem's dimensionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably why it's not a great idea to have a jerk like Dr. Strange walk around with it just hanging on his neck in a super obvious ornate piece of magical jewellery that all but screams \"steal me!\".\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How did the Time gem work in Dormammu\u0026#39;s dimension?","tags":["plot-explanation","marvel-cinematic-universe","doctor-strange"],"score":4,"question_id":62809,"answer_id":62817},{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe answer here is the key revelation that Strange comes to in the climactic scene: he \u003cem\u003etakes time with him\u003c/em\u003e into Dormammu's domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand this, we have to backtrack to the Ancient One explaining to Strange how magic works. She explains that there are many other dimensions, each of which has their own set of rules. Many of these dimensions do not follow our natural laws -- Dormammu's domain, for example, has no concept of \"time\". What exactly this means isn't clear, but the implication is that Dormammu, and those things in his realm, do not \"age\" or \"evolve\" or even \"change\", as those are all concepts associated with time. His domain exists and grows by absorbing other dimensions, at which point those other dimensions become eternally part of Domammu's realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo cast spells, sorcerers draw energy from those other dimensions and pull it into our world, allowing them to \"break the rules\" using that extra-dimensional energy.

The Eye allowed him to, in essence, pull a \"bubble\" of time with in, that affected himself and the area around him.

More abstractly, he clearly has might but he disorganized his priorities. He didn't watch over his family, he violently \"defended\" his castle and his kingdom. This leaves him with the dramatic irony of having successfully defend a physical home that will now forever be an empty, family-less home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a nod to the concept that a house is not necessarily a home -- meaning that where you live is not always as important as how you live and who you live with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDracula was given power and he chose to use it for might, rather than to reflect on his circumstances, weigh his options, cherish his loved-ones, and make decisions that protect what he truly, really cares about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ending of the film suggests that perhaps he has a second chance, but has he truly learned from his past, or has he stewed in his rage and sorrow and not really taken ownership for his misprioritization and his own flaws and failures. Her death was not necessarily his fault, but wouldn't she still be alive if they had abandoned their castle, or given in to the other kingdom, or if he simply prioritized his family above his landscape and physical possessions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWas her death a logical incongruity? From certain viewpoints: sure. It seems that there's an incomparable set of limitations between his powers from scene to scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as a narrative element, as a rational and logical element of the consequences of his choices, and as circumstances in the limitations of the physical world there seems to be a very blunt and obvious difference between the lateral motions of his thudding destruction against the standing army, and the vertical motion of his attempt to overcome the physical limits of gravity and velocity to prevent a death of a loved one whom he left in a blindspot out of his own pride and rage and self-righteousness. Even with great power, there a limits and more importantly there are consequences. Her death is the result of circumstance and a causality that could have been prevented, but its saving was never truly prioritized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would say that it's not illogical. It seems like a circumstantial cost, and, like much of the film's narrative, it deepens the humanity of Dracula in the sense of focusing on exemplifying that choices have consequences, and there are no powers, otherwordly or otherwise, that can overcome consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e[Note, as an aside, we should also be careful in \"overpraising\" this narrative as aimed at Dracula's \"humanization\", as this is very much a one-dimensional objectification and sadistic moralization of the otherwise-should-have-been-inherent personhood of his wife, because it's not entirely humanizing to contextualize one person's emotional journey while treating all other persons as objects of choice in their path. She was her own person with her own dreams and powers and experiences and future, and that's always a sticking point in these kinds of narratives that keeps them from being truly elevated conceptually beyond their surface elements. I think there is a lot of deep meaning here, but it's also very very muddy to reflect solely upon Dracula's experience, while every other \"person\" in his life is treated barely better than emotionally-conducive furniture.]\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why can\u0026#39;t Dracula save Mirena from falling even with supernatural powers?","tags":["plot-explanation","dracula-untold"],"score":0,"question_id":62814,"answer_id":62816}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":2186,"entidades":1.0}

Even many dramatic films were short films in this era. Starting in about 1915-1916, there was a huge spurt in feature film production by the major studios like Paramount. There were many, many studios back then, because Wall Street had not gotten into the movie business yet, and the industry had not consolidated into a few major studios. I don't see nearly enough features from this period in this graph. (Film production plummeted in 1918 due to shortages in film stock, manpower and raw materials like lumber. Also the flu epidemic greatly depressed audience attendance.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eApproximately 80% of the movies from the 1920s, and 90% of the movies from the 1910s are lost. No known copies exist. There are a large number of early sound films from 1929-1931 that are also missing, because they were not deemed good enough for re-issues in theaters and/or TV, and the studios did not preserve a copy. While the most famous lost films like CLEOPATRA (1917) and LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT (1927) still have ratings on the IMDB, they are from users who have not seen the film.

During the 1910s, the average feature was 50-70 minues, about the length of a TV show episode today. By the 1920s, most features were over an hour, but many prestige features were longer than two hours. In the 1930s and 1940s, \"double feature\" programs are very popular in theaters, and the second feature was almost always about an hour again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeature film production contracted in 1930-1932 due to the Great Depression and several studios going bankrupt.

Several genres experienced \"booms\" that decade, often with the help of popular movies from the '70s - sci-fi series like \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn\u0026amp;q=star%20wars%20episode%20v\u0026amp;s=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eStar Wars\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn\u0026amp;q=mad%20max\u0026amp;s=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eMad Max\u003c/a\u003e began in the 1970s, and their sequels continued into the 1980s, often to wild success.

Its primary functions are to create anticipation of what’s to come (in The Mummy we see the execution of Imhotep, creating anticipation of his returning from the dead); curiosity about how these events will involve the hero (in The Exorcist we have no idea what unearthing an artifact in the desert has to do with a mother and daughter in Georgetown); exposition that will be needed to understand later events in the story (seeing the “human element” stop the launch of the missile in War Games explains why the computer system was created);  and/or a wound that will lead to the hero’s inner conflict later in the story (a young Jo watching her father swept away by a tornado in Twister).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA BOOKEND\u003c/strong\u003e is a sequence that takes place some time after the action of the rest of the screenplay, prior to going back in time and telling the story. A bookend carries a similar function to hearing the words, “Once upon a time…” and often includes a character who will narrate the rest of the film. This device is especially useful in biographies and period pieces, because it draws us into the screenplay before taking us back in time to a setting that might be hard for an audience to relate to. The Princess Bride, Out of Africa, The Road to Perdition and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button all employ bookend/narrator openings. Occasionally the “present-day” bookend opening continues its own story line, and the screenplay intercuts between the two, as in Titanic, Fried Green Tomatoes and The Usual Suspects (although The Usual Suspects adds the more complex combination of two flashbacks – we open at the end of the story that Verbal Kent will later tell from the beginning in the BOOKEND sequence, that takes place in the police station).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA MID-STORY PEAK MOMENT\u003c/strong\u003e is a sequence of high conflict from somewhere in the middle of the story. We then go back to the “beginning” of the story, which will unfold chronologically until we’re again watching the opening sequence, this time played out to completion. This peak moment elicits strong emotion because of the conflict, creates anticipation of what we know is to come, and creates curiosity about how we’re going to get there, and how the hero will ever be able to overcome that conflict. Iron Man opens this way, with Tony Stark left for dead after an attack in Afghanistan. Seven Pounds opens with Ben Thomas calling 911 to report his own suicide. And in Mission Impossible 3, Ethan Hunt is threatened with the death of his fiancée if he doesn’t reveal the information that his nemesis demands.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA NEMESIS INTRODUCTION\u003c/strong\u003e opens with the character who will become the greatest obstacle to the hero achieving his goal. This could be a villain (The Joker in The Dark Knight), an opponent (Apollo Creed in Rocky), a romantic rival (Cal in Titanic or Zachary in Wedding Crashers), or simply a character in opposition to the hero (Mozart in Amadeus or Raymond in Rain Man). By introducing the Nemesis before your hero, you open with immediate conflict, you create anticipation of the jeopardy that awaits the hero when she must face the far more powerful (or far more evil) Nemesis of the screenplay, and you create curiosity about what will bring them together, and how the hero will ultimately prevail. This is why we are introduced to the Joker in the opening sequence of The Dark Knight, and why we meet the cyborg from the future in The Terminator before we see Sarah Connor living her everyday life as a waitress.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\u003csup\u003e\u003csub\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/8xECrG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"THE PROLOGUE OPENING, Michael Hauge: Story Mastery\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"Is there a term for the prologue story present in the opening of a film?","tags":["terminology"],"score":5,"question_id":62882,"answer_id":62891}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":2117,"entidades":1.0}

They help each other first, but they are equal, which means, they can perform the trick again.\nWell, guess what: they do the trick and the \"husband\" disappears while the \"engineer\" appears somewhere else and people think he teleported. The husband must stay hidden to fool everyone, including his wife, and the engineer must take his place and goes home to fill in his space. The wife notices the wound is fresh, and possibly notices other \"things\" while her real husband is in the engineer disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make it short, they had to switch places because it would be difficult to keep the secret from the wife and still perform the trick in public (which includes the wife).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat is my point of view.

For another thing, if the projections were static or had a static symbol, an infiltrator could theoretically learn what that symbol is and mimic it after he gets inside your dream.

The best we can do is just count the number we specifically see on-screen, which is around a dozen or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it does look like both Strange and Dormammu \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e remember each loop. It's obvious that Dormammu remembers; the whole point is that, after enough repeats, Dormammu gets frustrated and makes a deal just to escape. If he didn't remember the previous iterations of the time loop, there's no reason for him to ever get frustrated. Also, note that Dormammu tries something to kill Strange different every time, implying that he knows his previous attempts didn't succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Strange, too, changes his behavior as his loop repeats. In his opening line to Dormammu, he starts to sound bored and frustrated, which only makes sense if he knows he's done this before. Also, IIRC, he seemed prepared for Dormammu's various attacks after they'd been used on him once, which only makes sense if he remembered them.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How many times did Dr. Strange loop?","tags":["marvel-cinematic-universe","doctor-strange"],"score":12,"question_id":63012,"answer_id":63017}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1987,"entidades":1.0}

Despite this, he feels as though he does not fit in with his\n  family or their high-society friends. When his sister's ex-boyfriend\n  Blanchard gives him a surreptitiously recorded tape of what sounds\n  like his family engaged in a vile, murderous orgy, Bill begins to\n  suspect that his feelings are justified.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eBill gives the tape to his therapist Dr. Cleveland to listen to.

Bill insists that\n  what he'd heard before was real and calls Blanchard to get another\n  copy.

Bill awakens in a hospital bed and thinks he\n  hears Blanchard crying out, but discovers that nothing is there. He\n  leaves the hospital and finds his Jeep waiting for him. Milo tries to\n  warn him, but he drives back to his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003eBack home again, Bill finds a large, formal party.

The wealthy party guests strip to their\n  underwear and begin \"shunting\". The rich literally feed on the poor,\n  physically deforming and melding with each other as they suck the\n  nutrients out of Blanchard's body. Their intention is to do to the\n  same to Bill, but after escaping them and running about the house -\n  seeing his family melding with each other as well - Bill manages to\n  goad Ferguson into a fight. As the \"aliens\" cheer Ferguson on, Bill is\n  subdued, but in a surprise attack, Bill manages to reach inside the\n  pliable Ferguson and pull his head out through his buttocks, turning\n  him inside-out.

Universal Century makes up the dominating majority of the entire franchise. While many new Gundam stories are told in their own parallel universe with independent timelines, giving them a greater degree of creative freedom, the original U.C. storyline continues to be extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It established the series and delivered many of its best moments, as well as setting the standard for realistic hard science fiction in anime; the original Gundam marked the maturing of the Giant Robot genre. Also, nostalgia for the oldest of the Gundam shows (and Gundam's resulting status as a pop-culture icon in Japan) is still a major factor in its continuing success.\n  The creation of the separate timelines were originally stand-alone works that did not require prior knowledge of the Universal Century timeline to understand or appreciate the story's background. These timelines define Gundam differently and portray conflicts in entirely different settings and circumstances to other entries, including the definition of Gundam. For example, the original Gundam was considered a military general-purpose prototype mobile suit and a \"Gundam\" from G Gundam is considered a name for a mobile fighter whose purpose is to compete against other Gundams\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","title":"Early to mid 2000s Mech anime/show?","tags":["identify-this-tv-show"],"score":1,"question_id":63100,"answer_id":63112}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1899,"entidades":1.0}

A comic relief character often needs to look funny or fits a mock-able stereotype.  It's much easier for a male actor who looks goofy to have an extended career than a female one, so there is a larger pool of readily available talent for those kinds of roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor studios, themselves, are more interested in making money than the pure artistry, in general, so they like to keep recycling things that have made money for them.  Goofy male sidekick tends to go over well? They're going to greenlight projects with that, just like they like to do \"reboots\" of popular stories and sequels, or movies that fit a particular formula.  If they are nervous about general box-office appeal, they might even push for the addition of that element into a movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of time the comedy of the comic relief character is, to a large degree, laughing AT that character.  It's a bit safer and more comfortable, agree with it or not, to laugh at a male character without running into accusations of sexism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, while less common, those kids of roles do exist.  You see them all the time in movies that are more dominated by female characters because their companions who they interact with are going to be more heavily female-populated.  Even in more traditionally male-led casts, you will see some good ones.  Here's a few I can think of - \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJoan Cusak's role as John Cusak's office manager for his assassination business in Grosse Pointe Blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer Lawrence's ditsy, money-grubbing bored housewife role in American Hustle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa Tomei as Mona Lisa Vito, the girlfriend of Joe Pesci's character in My Cousin Vinny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhoopi Goldberg as the psychic in Ghost\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe title-specific role of Owen's mother in the movie Throw Mamma From the Train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI'm sure there are many others that people can think of.

Arriving at the\n  remote mining town, Ballard finds all of the people missing. She\n  learns that they had discovered an underground doorway created by an\n  ancient Martian civilization.

It also proposes a mystery, of which more is uncovered as the story develops. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's only a moment, but to my memory there is a large, dark house, being approached by several official-looking men (MACUSA I imagine), and a white-haired man defeating them all quickly and effortlessly. In movie-language, this effectively presents us with our main villain, dispelling any curiosities from the very beginning that there may be some involvement by Voldemort, Tom Riddle, or other familiar character from the Potterverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs this film was always intended to be the first of a series of films, there are several unanswered questions. One being the imagery of this introductory scene (which in its nature almost feels like a flashback, or in the HP-world, possibly a vision or premonition), but also the Lestrange lineage mentioned briefly. There is plenty to uncover throughout this series of films presented initially within this movie, and I believe most characters met in this film will feature again in future to explore their stories and character arcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI firmly believe that this introductory scene will best be played out as a slow-burn mystery, only revealing the meaning of the scene in the last film of the franchise. The Harry Potter films have found huge viral success and has sustauined its longevity by having so many small, tiny, seemingly insignificant details uncovered for years after its release. To embark on a new movie franchise, appealing to the same fans, and set in the same universe, without featuring hugely overarcing mysteries and secrets, would be a huge waste of a long-set up ideology.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"What does the first scene in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them mean?","tags":["plot-explanation","fantastic-beasts"],"score":0,"question_id":63724,"answer_id":63725}],"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":1275,"entidades":1.0}
